Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

Results comparing the baseline models and the NFP method indicate that NFP
consistently improves performance across diverse datasets and architectures
while maintaining minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Abstract: We propose Ming-Flash-Omni, an upgraded version of Ming-Omni, built upon a
sparser Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variant of Ling-Flash-2.0 with 100 billion
total parameters, of which only 6.1 billion are active per token. This
architecture enables highly efficient scaling (dramatically improving
computational efficiency while significantly expanding model capacity) and

Compared to its predecessor, the upgraded version exhibits substantial
improvements across multimodal understanding and generation. We significantly
advance speech recognition capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance
in contextual ASR and highly competitive results in dialect-aware ASR. In image
generation, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces high-fidelity text rendering and
demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during
image editing. Furthermore, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces generative segmentation,
a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance
but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing
consistency. Notably, Ming-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art results in
text-to-image generation and generative segmentation, and sets new records on
all 12 contextual ASR benchmarks, all within a single unified architecture.

challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive

multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to

metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited

architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available
at https://github.com/scu-zwh/TGBFN.

quantitatively study the performance characteristics of 190 real-world vision
transformers (ViTs) on mobile devices. Through a comparison with 102 real-world

influence the latency of ViT architectures on mobile devices. Based on these
insights, we develop a dataset including measured latencies of 1000 synthetic
ViTs with representative building blocks and state-of-the-art architectures
from two machine learning frameworks and six mobile platforms. Using this
dataset, we show that inference latency of new ViTs can be predicted with
sufficient accuracy for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities
within the digital learning sphere. Within this context, our study delves into
a solution for online learning authentication, utilizing an enhanced
convolutional neural network architecture, specifically the residual network
model. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this technological approach
aims to galvanize the ongoing progress of online education, while concurrently
bolstering its security and stability. Such fortification is imperative in
enabling online education to seamlessly align with the swift evolution of the
educational landscape. This paper's focal proposition involves the deployment
of the YOLOv5 network, meticulously trained on our proprietary dataset. This
network is tasked with identifying individuals' faces culled from images
captured by students' open online cameras. The resultant facial information is
then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood
clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2
convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%
specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was
employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on
synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based
pre-diagnostic healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate

fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user MIMO systems are highly vulnerable to

short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify
blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected
feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a
Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides
unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line
search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage

Abstract: We prove that ONN achieves order-optimal performance on convergence rate
($\mu \propto \lambda_2$), edge efficiency ($E = N$ for minimal connectivity $k
= 2$), and computational complexity ($O(N d^2)$). Empirical validation on
3M-node semantic networks demonstrates 99.75\% improvement over baseline
methods, confirming exponential convergence ($\mu = 3.2 \times 10^{-4}$) and
topology preservation. ORTSF integration into transformers achieves 14.7\%
perplexity reduction and 2.3 faster convergence on WikiText-103. We establish
deep connections to optimal control (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman), information
geometry (Fisher-efficient natural gradient), topological data analysis
(persistent homology computation in $O(KN)$), discrete geometry (Ricci flow),
and category theory (adjoint functors). This work transforms Massera's abstract
existence theorem into a concrete, scalable algorithm with provable guarantees,
opening pathways for constructive stability analysis in neural networks,
robotics, and distributed systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic stability of an electromagnetically
suspended vehicle, encountered in Hyperloop and Maglev systems, subject to
periodic excitations caused by surface irregularities or vibration of the
support induced by external noise. The narrow clearance between the vehicle and
the support can make it highly sensitive to small oscillations, since the
admissible amplitudes of the vehicle oscillations can be comparable to external
excitation amplitude. The vehicle is modelled as a three-degree-of-freedom
model where the vehicle is suspended via two identical electromagnetic
actuators from a rigid support that oscillates. The governing equations are
derived using force and torque balances, incorporating nonlinear
electromagnetic forces, and Kirchhoffs law for the electromagnets with PD
control strategy on the airgap. The equations of motion are linearized around
the steady state induced by the surface oscillation, yielding a system with
time-periodic coefficients. We analytically explore both principal and
combination parametric resonances using an extended Hills method, and Floquet
theory is used for numerical validation. The stability boundaries are obtained
as ellipses in control gain parameter space, and the influence of system
parameters on these boundaries is characterized. For the principal parametric
resonance, the ratio of the sizes of the two obtained ellipses is three to one,
whereas for the combination parametric resonance, the ratio is fourteen to one.
When all ellipses are simultaneously present, one of the ellipses associated
with the combination parametric resonance is the largest.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of nonlinear systems is essential for reliable control, yet
conventional identification methods often struggle to capture latent dynamics
while maintaining stability. We propose a \textit{stable-by-design LPV neural
network-based state-space} (NN-SS) model that simultaneously learns latent
states and internal scheduling variables directly from data. The
state-transition matrix, generated by a neural network using the learned
scheduling variables, is guaranteed to be stable through a Schur-based
parameterization. The architecture combines an encoder for initial state
estimation with a state-space representer network that constructs the full set
of scheduling-dependent system matrices. For training the NN-SS, we develop a
framework that integrates multi-step prediction losses with a state-consistency
regularization term, ensuring robustness against drift and improving
long-horizon prediction accuracy. The proposed NN-SS is evaluated on benchmark
nonlinear systems, and the results demonstrate that the model consistently
matches or surpasses classical subspace identification methods and recent
gradient-based approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
stability-constrained neural LPV identification as a scalable and reliable
framework for modeling complex nonlinear systems.

Abstract: As Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates in urban environments,
optimizing charging infrastructure is vital for balancing user satisfaction,
energy efficiency, and financial viability. This study advances beyond static
models by proposing a digital twin framework that integrates agent-based
decision support with embedded optimization to dynamically simulate EV charging
behaviors, infrastructure layouts, and policy responses across scenarios.
Applied to a localized urban site (a university campus) in Hanoi, Vietnam, the
model evaluates operational policies, EV station configurations, and renewable
energy sources. The interactive dashboard enables seasonal analysis, revealing
a 20% drop in solar efficiency from October to March, with wind power
contributing under 5% of demand, highlighting the need for adaptive energy
management. Simulations show that real-time notifications of newly available
charging slots improve user satisfaction, while gasoline bans and idle fees
enhance slot turnover with minimal added complexity. Embedded metaheuristic
optimization identifies near-optimal mixes of fast (30kW) and standard (11kW)
solar-powered chargers, balancing energy performance, profitability, and demand
with high computational efficiency. This digital twin provides a flexible,
computation-driven platform for EV infrastructure planning, with a
transferable, modular design that enables seamless scaling from localized to
city-wide urban contexts.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized Control Barrier Function (CBF) based
approach for highway merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). In
this control algorithm, each "host" vehicle negotiates with other agents in a
control zone of the highway network, and enacts its own action, to perform safe
and energy-efficient merge maneuvers. It uses predictor-corrector loops within
the robust CBF setting for negotiation and to reconcile disagreements that may
arise. There is no explicit order of vehicles and no priority. A notable
feature is absence of gridlocks due to instability of the inter-agent system.
Results from Monte Carlo simulations show significant improvement in the
system-wide energy efficiency and traffic flow compared to a first-in-first-out
approach, as well as enhanced robustness of the proposed decentralized
controller compared to its centralized counterpart.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of autonomous vehicle technologies, effective
path-tracking control has become a critical component in ensuring safety and
efficiency in complex traffic scenarios. When a high level decision making
agent generates a collision free path, a robust low level controller is
required to precisely follow this trajectory. However, connected autonomous
vehicles (CAV) are inherently affected by communication delays and computation
delays, which significantly degrade the performance of conventional controllers
such as PID or other more advanced controllers like disturbance observers
(DOB). While DOB-based designs have shown effectiveness in rejecting
disturbances under nominal conditions, their performance deteriorates
considerably in the presence of unknown time delays. To address this challenge,
this paper proposes a delay-tolerant communication disturbance observer (CDOB)
framework for path-tracking control in delayed systems. The proposed CDOB
compensates for the adverse effects of time delays, maintaining accurate
trajectory tracking even under uncertain and varying delay conditions. It is
shown through a simulation study that the proposed control architecture
maintains close alignment with the reference trajectory across various
scenarios, including single lane change, double-= lane change, and Elastic Band
generated collision avoidance paths under various time delays. Simulation
results further demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional
approaches in both tracking accuracy and delay robustness, making it well
suited for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Traditional reachability methods provide formal guarantees of safety under
bounded disturbances. However, they strictly enforce state constraints as
inviolable, which can result in overly conservative or infeasible solutions in
complex operational scenarios. Many constraints encountered in practice, such
as bounds on battery state of charge in electric vehicles, recommended speed
envelopes, and comfort constraints in passenger-carrying vehicles, are
inherently soft. Soft constraints allow temporary violations within predefined
safety margins to accommodate uncertainty and competing operational demands,
albeit at a cost such as increased wear or higher operational expenses. This
paper introduces a novel soft-constrained reachability framework that extends
Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for the formal verification of
safety-critical systems subject to both hard and soft constraints.
Specifically, the framework characterizes a subset of the state space, referred
to as the soft-constrained reach-avoid set, from which the system is guaranteed
to reach a desired set safely, under worst-case disturbances, while ensuring
that cumulative soft-constraint violations remain within a user-specified
budget. The framework comprises two principal components: (i) an
augmented-state model with an auxiliary budget state that tracks
soft-constraint violations, and (ii) a regularization-based approximation of
the discontinuous Hamilton-Jacobi value function associated with the
reach-avoid differential game studied herein. The effectiveness of the proposed
framework is demonstrated through numerical examples involving the landing of a
simple point-mass model and a fixed-wing aircraft executing an emergency
descent, both under wind disturbances. The simulation results validate the
framework's ability to simultaneously manage both hard and soft constraints in
safety-critical settings

Abstract: Controllers designed with reinforcement learning can be sensitive to model
mismatch. We demonstrate that designing such controllers in a virtual
simulation environment with an inaccurate model is not suitable for deployment
in a physical setup. Controllers designed using an accurate model is robust
against disturbance and small mismatch between the physical setup and the
mathematical model derived from first principles; while a poor model results in
a controller that performs well in simulation but fails in physical
experiments. Sensitivity analysis is used to justify these discrepancies and an
empirical region of attraction estimation help us visualize their robustness.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services,
data centers have become critical infrastructures driving digital economies,
with increasing energy demand heightening concerns over electricity use and
carbon emissions, emphasizing the need for carbon-aware infrastructure
planning. Most studies assume static power systems, focus only on operational
emissions, and overlook co-optimization. This paper proposes a dynamic joint
planning framework that co-optimizes long-term data center and power system
development over 15 years. The model determines siting, capacity, and type of
data centers alongside power generation expansion, storage deployment, and
retirements, accounting for both operational and embodied emissions. To handle
multi-scale uncertainty, a large-scale two-stage stochastic program is
formulated and solved via an enhanced Benders decomposition. Applied to the PJM
Interconnection, with curated datasets released on GitHub, results show the
system can support up to 55 GW peak data center demand, with Virginia (DOM) and
Northern Illinois (ComEd) as optimal hosts. Compared to non-joint planning, the
framework cuts investment cost by 12.6%, operational cost by 8.25%, and
emissions by 5.63%. Including lifecycle emissions further raises renewable
deployment by 25.5%, highlighting embodied carbon's role in deeper
decarbonization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In linear time-invariant systems, the sensitivity function to disturbances is
designed under a sensitivity tradeoff known as the waterbed effect. To
compensate for a quasiperiodic disturbance, a quasiperiodic disturbance
observer using time delays was proposed. Its sensitivity function avoids the
sensitivity tradeoff, achieving wideband harmonic suppression without
amplifying aperiodic disturbances or shifting harmonic suppression frequencies.
However, its open-loop transfer function is not rational and does not satisfy
the assumptions of existing Bode sensitivity integrals due to its time delays.
This paper provides Bode-like sensitivity integrals for the quasiperiodic
disturbance observer in both continuous-time and discrete-time representations
and clarifies the avoided sensitivity tradeoff with time delays.

Abstract: The continuous miniaturisation of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors (MOSFETs) from long- to short-channel architectures has advanced
beyond the predictions of Moore's Law. Continued advances in semiconductor
electronics, even near current scaling and performance boundaries under
cryogenic conditions, are driving the development of innovative device
paradigms that enable ultra-low-power and high-speed functionality. Among
emerging candidates, the Josephson Junction Field-Effect Transistor (JJFET or
JoFET) provides an alternative by integrating superconducting source and drain
electrodes for efficient, phase-coherent operation at ultra-low temperatures.
These hybrid devices have the potential to bridge conventional semiconductor
electronics with cryogenic logic and quantum circuits, enabling
energy-efficient and high-coherence signal processing across temperature
domains. This review traces the evolution from Josephson junctions to
field-effect transistors, emphasising the structural and functional innovations
that underpin modern device scalability. The performance and material
compatibility of JJFETs fabricated on Si, GaAs, and InGaAs substrates are
analysed, alongside an assessment of their switching dynamics and material
compatibility. Particular attention is given to
superconductor-silicon-superconductor Josephson junctions as the active core of
JJFET architectures. By unfolding more than four decades of experimental
progress, this work highlights the promise of JJFETs as foundational building
blocks for next-generation cryogenic logic and quantum electronic systems.

Abstract: Lane changes are common yet challenging driving maneuvers that require
continuous decision-making and dynamic interaction with surrounding vehicles.
Relying solely on human drivers for lane-changing can lead to traffic
disturbances due to the stochastic nature of human behavior and its variability
under different task demands. Such uncertainties may significantly degrade
traffic string stability, which is critical for suppressing disturbance
propagation and ensuring smooth merging of the lane-changing vehicles. This
paper presents a human-automation shared lane-changing control framework that
preserves driver authority while allowing automated assistance to achieve
stable maneuvers in the presence of driver's behavioral uncertainty. Human
driving behavior is modeled as a Markov jump process with transitions driven by
task difficulty, providing a tractable representation of stochastic state
switching. Based on this model, we first design a nominal stabilizing
controller that guarantees stochastic ${L}_2$ string stability under imperfect
mode estimation. To further balance performance and automated effort, we then
develop a Minimal Intervention Controller (MIC) that retains acceptable
stability while limiting automation. Simulations using lane-changing data from
the NGSIM dataset verify that the nominal controller reduces speed
perturbations and shorten lane-changing time, while the MIC further reduces
automated effort and enhances comfort but with moderate stability and
efficiency loss. Validations on the TGSIM dataset with SAE Level 2 vehicles
show that the MIC enables earlier lane changes than Level 2 control while
preserving driver authority with a slight stability compromise. These findings
highlight the potential of shared control strategies to balance stability,
efficiency, and driver acceptance.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully data-driven control framework for autonomous

The approach eliminates the need for explicit hydrodynamic modeling by
exploiting measured input-output data to predict and optimize future system
behavior. Classic DeePC was employed in the heading control, while a cascaded
DeePC architecture is proposed for depth regulation, incorporating a
loop-frequency separation to handle the different dynamic modes of input and
output. For 3-D waypoint path following, the Adaptive Line-of-Sight algorithm
is extended to a predictive formulation and integrated with DeePC. All methods
are validated in extensive simulation on the REMUS 100 AUV and compared with
classical PI/PID control. The results demonstrate superior tracking performance
and robustness of DeePC under ocean-current disturbances and nonlinear
operating conditions, while significantly reducing modeling effort.

Abstract: Trajectory planning in dense, interactive traffic scenarios presents
significant challenges for autonomous vehicles, primarily due to the
uncertainty of human driver behavior and the non-convex nature of collision
avoidance constraints. This paper introduces a stochastic optimal control
framework to address these issues simultaneously, without excessively
conservative approximations. We opt to model human driver decisions as a Markov
Decision Process and propose a method for handling collision avoidance between
non-convex vehicle shapes by imposing a positive distance constraint between
compact sets. In this framework, we investigate three alternative chance
constraint formulations. To ensure computational tractability, we introduce
tight, continuously differentiable reformulations of both the non-convex
distance constraints and the chance constraints. The efficacy of our approach
is demonstrated through simulation studies of two challenging interactive
scenarios: an unregulated intersection crossing and a highway lane change in
dense traffic.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving
data privacy, but high communication and computation costs, exacerbated by
statistical and device heterogeneity, limit its practicality in mobile edge
computing. Existing compression methods like sparsification and pruning reduce
per-round costs but may increase training rounds and thus the total training
cost, especially under heterogeneous environments. We propose a lightweight
personalized FL framework built on parameter decoupling, which separates the
model into shared and private subspaces, enabling us to uniquely apply gradient
sparsification to the shared component and model pruning to the private one.
This structural separation confines communication compression to global
knowledge exchange and computation reduction to local personalization,
protecting personalization quality while adapting to heterogeneous client
resources. We theoretically analyze convergence under the combined effects of
sparsification and pruning, revealing a sparsity-pruning trade-off that links
to the iteration complexity. Guided by this analysis, we formulate a joint
optimization that selects per-client sparsity and pruning rates and wireless
bandwidth to reduce end-to-end training time. Simulation results demonstrate
faster convergence and substantial reductions in overall communication and
computation costs with negligible accuracy loss, validating the benefits of
coordinated and resource-aware personalization in resource-constrained
heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) corridors in
sixth-generation (6G) networks requires safe, intelligence-driven integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC). Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)
enhance spectrum efficiency, localisation accuracy, and situational awareness,
while introducing new vulnerabilities. The rise of quantum computing increases
the risks associated with harvest-now-decrypt-later strategies and
quantum-enhanced spoofing. We propose a Quantum-Resilient Threat Modelling
(QRTM) framework for RIS-assisted ISAC in UAV corridors to address these
challenges. QRTM integrates classical, quantum-ready, and quantum-aided
adversaries, countered using post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) primitives:
ML-KEM for key establishment and Falcon for authentication, both embedded
within RIS control signalling and UAV coordination. To strengthen security
sensing, the framework introduces RIS-coded scene watermarking validated
through a generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT), with its detection
probability characterised by the Marcum Q function. Furthermore, a Secure ISAC
Utility (SIU) jointly optimises secrecy rate, spoofing detection, and
throughput under RIS constraints, enabled by a scheduler with computational
complexity of O(n^2). Monte Carlo evaluations using 3GPP Release 19 mid-band
urban-canyon models (7-15 GHz) demonstrate a spoof-detection probability
approaching 0.99 at a false-alarm rate of 1e-3, secrecy-rate retention
exceeding 90 percent against quantum-capable adversaries, and
signal-interference utilisation improvements of about 25 percent compared with
baselines. These results show a standards-compliant path towards reliable,
quantum-resilient ISAC for UAV corridors in smart cities and non-terrestrial

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a new neural network (NN) paradigm for scalable and
generalizable stability analysis of power systems. The paradigm consists of two
parts: the neural stability descriptor and the sample-augmented iterative
training scheme. The first part, based on system decomposition, constructs the
object (such as a stability function or condition) for stability analysis as a
scalable aggregation of multiple NNs. These NNs remain fixed across varying
power system structures and parameters, and are repeatedly shared within each
system instance defined by these variations, thereby enabling the
generalization of the neural stability descriptor across a class of power
systems. The second part learns the neural stability descriptor by iteratively
training the NNs with sample augmentation, guided by the tailored
conservativeness-aware loss function. The training set is strategically
constructed to promote the descriptor's generalizability, which is
systematically evaluated by verification and validation during the training
process. Specifically, the proposed NN paradigm is implemented for
large-disturbance stability analysis of the bulk power grid and
small-disturbance stability conditions of the microgrid system. Finally,
numerical studies for the two implementations demonstrate the applicability and
effectiveness of the proposed NN paradigm.

Abstract: Efficient truck platooning is a key strategy for reducing freight costs,
lowering fuel consumption, and mitigating emissions. Deadlines are critical in
this context, as trucks must depart within specific time windows to meet
delivery requirements and avoid penalties. In this paper, we investigate the
optimal formation and dispatch of truck platoons at a highway station with
finite capacity $L$ and deadline constraints $T$. The system operates in
discrete time, with each arriving truck assigned a deadline of $T$ slot units.
The objective is to leverage the efficiency gains from forming large platoons
while accounting for waiting costs and deadline violations. We formulate the
problem as a Markov decision process and analyze the structure of the optimal
policy $\pi^\star$ for $L = 3$, extending insights to arbitrary $L$. We prove
that the $\pi^\star$ is monotone in the state space $\mathcal{S}$ and identify
classes of unreachable states. Moreover, since $\mathcal{S}$ grows
exponentially with $L$ and $T$, we propose heuristics-including conditional and
deep-learning based approaches-that exploit these structural insights while
maintaining low computational complexity.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework that incorporates
social awareness into multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics to achieve
prescribed-time reach-avoid-stay tasks in dynamic environments. Each agent is
assigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or
self-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system.
Building on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT
framework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its
social interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law
is derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby
avoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a
socially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The
proposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is
computationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances.
The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through
simulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional

Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy, particularly offshore wind,
introduces significant uncertainty into hybrid AC-HVDC systems due to forecast
errors and power fluctuations. Conventional control strategies typically rely
on fixed setpoints and neglect frequency deviations, which can compromise
system stability under rapid renewable variations. To address this challenge,
this paper presents a forecast-integrated, optimal power flow (OPF)-based
adaptive control framework. Wind speed forecasts generated using a Random
Forest model are incorporated into a time-coupled OPF to determine baseline
converter setpoints in anticipation of wind fluctuations, which are further
adjusted in real time based on actual operating conditions. An adaptive droop
control scheme is developed that jointly considers DC voltage and AC frequency
deviations. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is validated
through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, demonstrating its capability to
ensure stable and robust operation of hybrid AC-HVDC systems under high
penetration of renewable energy.

switches. The Schottky barrier engineering was performed with a composite Pt
cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) anode contact to take advantage of the enhanced reverse
blocking capabilities enabled by PtOx while allowing low turn-on voltage by the
interfacing thin Pt layer. We also performed a systematic study using a
co-processed Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on the same
wafer. The bare SBDs revealed a breakdown voltage of ~1.5 kV, while the
field-plate Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs achieved an increased breakdown voltage
of 2.75 kV owing to the edge field management. Further enhancement of the
breakdown voltage was achieved by tunneling leakage management using composite
Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts that ultimately enabled breakdown
voltage of 3.7 kV for the field-plate diodes. Remarkably, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt
(1.5 nm) Schottky contacts maintained similar turn-on voltage as the Pt/(011)
\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs. The combination of efficient tunneling leakage management
by composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts with similar turn-on voltage,
edge field reduction by high-\k{appa} dielectric ZrO2 field plate, as well as
the advantageous material properties offered by (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 demonstrate
a promising strategy for developing ultra-low leakage and multi-kV class
vertical (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices.

Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method
for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural
connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies
primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial
trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the
functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is
increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using
functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information
for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore,
microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed
from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the
clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering
framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint
multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM
parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural
characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber
tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining
module to compute embedding features from each source of information
separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional
signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine
the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two
state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance
in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.

Abstract: Secure and reliable medical image classification is crucial for effective
patient treatment, but centralized models face challenges due to data and
privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborations but struggles with heterogeneous, non-IID data and high
communication costs, especially in large networks. We propose
\textbf{CFL-SparseMed}, an FL approach that uses Top-k Sparsification to reduce
communication overhead by transmitting only the top k gradients. This unified
solution effectively addresses data heterogeneity while maintaining model
accuracy. It enhances FL efficiency, preserves privacy, and improves diagnostic
accuracy and patient care in non-IID medical imaging settings. The

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Semantic communication is a promising technique for emerging wireless
applications, which reduces transmission overhead by transmitting only
task-relevant features instead of raw data. However, existing methods struggle
under extremely low bandwidth and varying channel conditions, where corrupted
or missing semantics lead to severe reconstruction errors. To resolve this
difficulty, we propose a world foundation model (WFM)-aided semantic video
transmission framework that leverages the predictive capability of WFMs to
generate future frames based on the current frame and textual guidance. This
design allows transmissions to be omitted when predictions remain reliable,
thereby saving bandwidth. Through WFM's prediction, the key semantics are
preserved, yet minor prediction errors tend to amplify over time. To mitigate
issue, a lightweight depth-based feedback module is introduced to determine
whether transmission of the current frame is needed. Apart from transmitting
the entire frame, a segmentation-assisted partial transmission method is
proposed to repair degraded frames, which can further balance performance and
bandwidth cost. Furthermore, an active transmission strategy is developed for
mobile scenarios by exploiting camera trajectory information and proactively
scheduling transmissions before channel quality deteriorates. Simulation
results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces transmission
overhead while maintaining task performances across varying scenarios and
channel conditions.

Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically
relevant captions for MRI scans. Our system combines a DEiT-Small vision
transformer as an image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and a
custom LSTM-based decoder. The architecture is designed to semantically align
image and textual embeddings, using hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive
inference via vector similarity. We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe
dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI
images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including
BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches. Results show that
focusing on domain-specific data improves caption accuracy and semantic
alignment. Our work proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated
medical image reporting.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for single-image
restoration, but their application to zero-shot video restoration suffers from
temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and
complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling. In this work, we
address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration
using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying
their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1)
Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired
perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising
process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature
penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as
Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path
Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by
ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion)
scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these
training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable
high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion
models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and
degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their
strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal
naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves
fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.

Abstract: A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the
electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is
introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the
non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse
solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a
single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple
plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data,
thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the
non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into
the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space
of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent
with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest
scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered
fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled
datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative
labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of
scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high
quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with
excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of
hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust,
data-driven microwave imaging.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling

rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of

framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in

synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper
presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The
model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully
parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for
windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal
state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse
generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,
and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the
Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,
outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast
majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than
existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.
We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,
providing a reproducible foundation for future research.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among

measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible
computational graphs. BOND demonstrates improved accuracy and scalability from
existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such

mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graph embedding (UnKGE) methods learn vector
representations that capture both structural and uncertainty information to
predict scores of unseen triples. However, existing methods produce only point
estimates, without quantifying predictive uncertainty-limiting their
reliability in high-stakes applications where understanding confidence in
predictions is crucial. To address this limitation, we propose \textsc{UnKGCP},
a framework that generates prediction intervals guaranteed to contain the true
score with a user-specified level of confidence. The length of the intervals
reflects the model's predictive uncertainty. \textsc{UnKGCP} builds on the
conformal prediction framework but introduces a novel nonconformity measure
tailored to UnKGE methods and an efficient procedure for interval construction.
We provide theoretical guarantees for the intervals and empirically verify
these guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks across diverse
UnKGE methods further demonstrate that the intervals are sharp and effectively
capture predictive uncertainty.

Abstract: Tree ensembles have demonstrated state-of-the-art predictive performance
across a wide range of problems involving tabular data. Nevertheless, the
black-box nature of tree ensembles is a strong limitation, especially for
applications with critical decisions at stake. The Hoeffding or ANOVA
functional decomposition is a powerful explainability method, as it breaks down
black-box models into a unique sum of lower-dimensional functions, provided
that input variables are independent. In standard learning settings, input
variables are often dependent, and the Hoeffding decomposition is generalized
through hierarchical orthogonality constraints. Such generalization leads to
unique and sparse decompositions with well-defined main effects and
interactions. However, the practical estimation of this decomposition from a
data sample is still an open problem. Therefore, we introduce the TreeHFD
algorithm to estimate the Hoeffding decomposition of a tree ensemble from a
data sample. We show the convergence of TreeHFD, along with the main properties
of orthogonality, sparsity, and causal variable selection. The high performance
of TreeHFD is demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real data,
using our treehfd Python package (https://github.com/ThalesGroup/treehfd).
Besides, we empirically show that the widely used TreeSHAP method, based on
Shapley values, is strongly connected to the Hoeffding decomposition.

Abstract: We present a general strategy for turning generative models into candidate
solution samplers for batch Bayesian optimization (BO). The use of generative
models for BO enables large batch scaling as generative sampling, optimization
of non-continuous design spaces, and high-dimensional and combinatorial design.
Inspired by the success of direct preference optimization (DPO), we show that
one can train a generative model with noisy, simple utility values directly
computed from observations to then form proposal distributions whose densities
are proportional to the expected utility, i.e., BO's acquisition function
values. Furthermore, this approach is generalizable beyond preference-based
feedback to general types of reward signals and loss functions. This
perspective avoids the construction of surrogate (regression or classification)
models, common in previous methods that have used generative models for
black-box optimization. Theoretically, we show that the generative models
within the BO process approximately follow a sequence of distributions which
asymptotically concentrate at the global optima under certain conditions. We
also demonstrate this effect through experiments on challenging optimization
problems involving large batches in high dimensions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the convergence of off-policy TD(0) with linear function
approximation when used to approximate the expected discounted reward in a
Markov chain. It is well known that the combination of off-policy learning and
function approximation can lead to divergence of the algorithm. Existing
results for this setting modify the algorithm, for instance by reweighing the
updates using importance sampling. This establishes convergence at the expense
of additional complexity. In contrast, our approach is to analyse the standard
algorithm, but to restrict our attention to the class of reversible Markov
chains. We demonstrate convergence under this mild reversibility condition on
the structure of the chain, which in many applications can be assumed using
domain knowledge. In particular, we establish a convergence guarantee under an
upper bound on the discount factor in terms of the difference between the
on-policy and off-policy process. This improves upon known results in the
literature that state that convergence holds for a sufficiently small discount
factor by establishing an explicit bound. Convergence is with probability one
and achieves projected Bellman error equal to zero. To obtain these results, we
adapt the stochastic approximation framework that was used by Tsitsiklis and
Van Roy [1997 for the on-policy case, to the off-policy case. We illustrate our
results using different types of reversible Markov chains, such as
one-dimensional random walks and random walks on a weighted graph.

Abstract: Many rare diseases offer limited established treatment options, leading
patients to switch therapies when new medications emerge. To analyze the impact
of such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare
disease trials, it is important to use all available data sources. This,
however, is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the
observation period, for example when instruments are adapted to specific age
ranges. The resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories, complicate the
application of traditional modeling approaches like mixed-effects regression.
We tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned
low-dimensional temporal trajectory, enabling longitudinal modeling across
instruments. Specifically, we employ a set of variational autoencoder
architectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time
point. Temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured
through a mixed-effects regression model applied to latent representations. To
enable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach
that accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression
and variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact
of treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Here, our
approach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments
for mixed-effects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed
item level to quantify the treatment switch effect. Our approach allows for
model selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching. The
results highlight the potential of modeling in joint latent representations for
addressing small data challenges.

Abstract: Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked
Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to
reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the
price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting
computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative
entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per
iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence
length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the
gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of
unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal
schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data
distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We
define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical
derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and
transparent proofs.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for image classification have led to impressive
advances in that field. For example, convolutional neural networks are able to
achieve remarkable image classification accuracy across a wide range of
applications in industry, defense, and other areas. While these machine
learning models boast impressive accuracy, a related concern is how to assess
and maintain calibration in the predictions these models make. A classification
model is said to be well calibrated if its predicted probabilities correspond
with the rates events actually occur. While there are many available methods to
assess machine learning calibration and recalibrate faulty predictions, less
effort has been spent on developing approaches that continually monitor
predictive models for potential loss of calibration as time passes. We propose
a cumulative sum-based approach with dynamic limits that enable detection of
miscalibration in both traditional process monitoring and concept drift
applications. This enables early detection of operational context changes that
impact image classification performance in the field. The proposed chart can be
used broadly in any situation where the user needs to monitor probability
predictions over time for potential lapses in calibration. Importantly, our
method operates on probability predictions and event outcomes and does not
require under-the-hood access to the machine learning model.

Abstract: Pretrained Transformers demonstrate remarkable in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, enabling them to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without
parameter updates. However, theoretical studies often rely on simplified
architectures (e.g., omitting MLPs), data models (e.g., linear regression with
isotropic inputs), and single-source training, limiting their relevance to
realistic settings. In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with
nonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with
heterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where
the MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single
gradient step and the second layer fully optimized. Under high-dimensional
asymptotics, we prove that such models are equivalent in ICL error to
structured polynomial predictors, leveraging results from the theory of
Gaussian universality and orthogonal polynomials. This equivalence reveals that
nonlinear MLPs meaningfully enhance ICL performance, particularly on nonlinear
tasks, compared to linear baselines. It also enables a precise analysis of data
mixing effects: we identify key properties of high-quality data sources (low
noise, structured covariances) and show that feature learning emerges only when
the task covariance exhibits sufficient structure. These results are validated
empirically across various activation functions, model sizes, and data
distributions. Finally, we experiment with a real-world scenario involving
multilingual sentiment analysis where each language is treated as a different
source. Our experimental results for this case exemplify how our findings
extend to real-world cases. Overall, our work advances the theoretical
foundations of ICL in Transformers and provides actionable insight into the
role of architecture and data in ICL.

Abstract: While generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), are
ubiquitous in today's world, principled mechanisms to assess their
(in)correctness are limited. Using the conformal prediction framework, previous
works construct sets of LLM responses where the probability of including an
incorrect response, or error, is capped at a desired user-defined tolerance
level. However, since these methods are based on p-values, they are susceptible
to p-hacking, i.e., choosing the tolerance level post-hoc can invalidate the
guarantees. We therefore leverage e-values to complement generative model
outputs with e-scores as a measure of incorrectness. In addition to achieving
the same statistical guarantees as before, e-scores provide users flexibility
in adaptively choosing tolerance levels after observing the e-scores
themselves, by upper bounding a post-hoc notion of error called size
distortion. We experimentally demonstrate their efficacy in assessing LLM
outputs for different correctness types: mathematical factuality and property
constraints satisfaction.
