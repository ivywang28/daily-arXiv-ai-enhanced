Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a
lasting resource to drive future innovation toward robust, clinically
translatable tools.

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.
In our implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9%
accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role

decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at

scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption

components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical
diagnostic scenarios. Project page is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher

switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.
Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on
standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art
trackers, with integrated implementations of baselines for fair comparison.
Potential directions for future work are also discussed. The source-code

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and

to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains

performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an
application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909
fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In
addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both
pathologists and AI systems that might support human experts. All experiments

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

Abstract: Solving for globally optimal line switching decisions in AC transmission
grids can be intractability slow. Machine learning (ML) models, meanwhile, can
be trained to predict near-optimal decisions at a fraction of the speed.
Verifying the performance and impact of these ML models on network operation,
however, is a critically important step prior to their actual deployment. In
this paper, we train a Neural Network (NN) to solve the optimal power shutoff
line switching problem. To assess the worst-case load shedding induced by this
model, we propose a bilevel attacker-defender verification approach that finds
the NN line switching decisions that cause the highest quantity of network load
shedding. Solving this problem to global optimality is challenging (due to AC
power flow and NN nonconvexities), so our approach exploits a convex relaxation
of the AC physics, combined with a local NN search, to find a guaranteed lower
bound on worst--case load shedding. These under-approximation bounds are solved
via MathOptAI.jl. We benchmark against a random sampling approach, and we find
that our optimization-based approach always finds larger load shedding. Test
results are collected on multiple PGLib test cases and on trained NN models
which contain more than 10 million model parameters.

Abstract: Cardiac auscultation is an essential clinical skill, requiring excellent
hearing to distinguish subtle differences in timing and pitch of heart sounds.
However, diagnosing solely from these sounds is often challenging due to
interference from surrounding noise, and the information may be limited.
Existing solutions that adaptively cancel external noise are either not
real-time or are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for
implementation in a portable system. This work proposes an end-to-end system
with a real-time adaptive noise cancellation pipeline integrated into a device
that simultaneously acquires electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG)
signals. The performance of the system is validated using real-world hospital
noise datasets and recordings captured with the dual-modality device. For PCG
and ECG signals recorded from the device in noisy hospital settings, the
proposed algorithms achieved signal-to-noise ratio improvements of 37.01 dB and
30.32 dB, respectively. These results demonstrate the systems effectiveness in
enabling reliable and accessible cardiac screening, including noisy hospital
environments typical of resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Realizing high long-term task completion rates represents a fundamental
challenge in battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices powered by ambient
energy harvesting. This difficulty is primarily due to the stochastic and
time-varying characteristics of the available energy, which significantly
complicate the design of optimal task scheduling policies. In this paper, we
consider a battery-less IoT device that must periodically report sensing
measurements to a monitoring center. We adopt the Markov decision process (MDP)
framework to handle energy variability while aiming to maximize the long-term
task completion rate. For this, we first identify its components and then
define two appropriate reward functions. We demonstrate the inherent properties
associated with the MDP formulation and the related optimal policy.
Subsequently, we solve the resulting optimization problem, leading to the
optimal stationary threshold-based (OSTB) scheduling. Simulation results
demonstrate that OSTB outperforms the well-known ``as late as possible'' (ALAP)
scheduling strategy. For instance, an $8.6\%$ increase in the task completion
rate, along with a $65\%$ reduction in power failures and a $86.29\%$ decrease
in execution delays during task execution are registered assuming a $4.7$ mF

Abstract: The increasing integration of intermittent distributed energy resources
(DERs) has introduced significant variability in distribution networks, posing
challenges to voltage regulation and reactive power management. This paper
presents a novel neural two-stage stochastic Volt-VAR optimization (2S-VVO)
method for three-phase unbalanced distribution systems considering network
reconfiguration under uncertainty. To address the computational intractability
associated with solving large-scale scenario-based 2S-VVO problems, a
learning-based acceleration strategy is introduced, wherein the second-stage
recourse model is approximated by a neural network. This neural approximation
is embedded into the optimization model as a mixed-integer linear program
(MILP), enabling effective enforcement of operational constraints related to
the first-stage decisions. Numerical simulations on a 123-bus unbalanced
distribution system demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 50
times speedup compared to conventional solvers and decomposition methods, while
maintaining a typical optimality gap below 0.30%. These results underscore the
method's efficacy and scalability in addressing large-scale stochastic VVO
problems under practical operating conditions.

Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale
electricity markets, as mandated by FERC Order 2222, imposes new challenges on
system operations. To remain consistent with existing market structures,
regional transmission organizations (RTOs) have advanced the aggregation of
transmission-node-level DERs (T-DERs), where a nodal virtual power plant (VPP)
represents the mapping of all distribution-level DERs to their respective
transmission nodes. This paper develops a real-time economic dispatch (RTED)
framework that enables multi-transmission-node DER aggregation while addressing
computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph
convolutional network (ST-GCN) for adaptive prediction of distribution factors
(DFs), thereby capturing the dynamic influence of individual T-DERs across the
transmission system. Furthermore, an iterative constraint identification
strategy is incorporated to alleviate transmission security constraints without
compromising system reliability. Together, these innovations accelerate the
market clearing process and support the effective participation of T-DER
aggregators under current market paradigms. The proposed approach is validated
on large-scale test systems, including modified 118-, 2383-, and 3012-bus
networks under a rolling RTED setting with real demand data. Numerical results
demonstrate significant improvements in reducing operational costs and
maintaining transmission network feasibility, underscoring the scalability and
practicality of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Quantifying locational carbon emissions in power grids is crucial for
implementing effective carbon reduction strategies for customers relying on
electricity. This paper presents a carbon-aware optimal power flow (OPF)
framework that incorporates data-driven carbon tracing, enabling rapid
estimation of nodal carbon emissions from electric loads. By developing
generator-to-load carbon emission distribution factors through data-driven
technique, the analytical formulas for both average and marginal carbon
emissions can be derived and integrated seamlessly into DC OPF models as linear
constraints. The proposed carbon-aware OPF model enables market operators to
optimize energy dispatch while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Simulations
on IEEE test systems confirm the accuracy and computational efficiency of the
proposed approach, highlighting its applicability for real-time carbon-aware
system operations.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are
widely used to model complex data dependencies and inter-task communication.
However, existing DAG scheduling approaches oversimplify data fusion tasks by
assuming fixed triggering mechanisms, failing to capture the diverse fusion
patterns found in real-world ADS software stacks. In this paper, we propose a
systematic framework for analyzing various fusion patterns and their
performance implications in ADS. Our framework models three distinct fusion
task types: timer-triggered, wait-for-all, and immediate fusion, which
comprehensively represent real-world fusion behaviors. Our Integer Linear
Programming (ILP)-based approach enables an optimization of multiple real-time
performance metrics, including reaction time, time disparity, age of
information, and response time, while generating deterministic offline
schedules directly applicable to real platforms. Evaluation using real-world
ADS case studies, Raspberry Pi implementation, and randomly generated DAGs
demonstrates that our framework handles diverse fusion patterns beyond the
scope of existing work, and achieves substantial performance improvements in
comparable scenarios.

Abstract: Large-format lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) provide effective energy storage
solutions for high-power equipment used in underground mining operations. They
have high Columbic efficiency and minimal heat and emission footprints.
However, improper use of LIBs, accidents, or other factors may increase the
probability of thermal runaway (TR), a rapid combustion reaction that
discharges toxic and flammable substances. Several such incidents have been
documented in mines. Since repeatable TR experiments to uncover the
transient-state propagation of TR are expensive and hazardous, high-fidelity
models are usually developed to mimic the impact of these events. They are
resource-intensive and are impractical to develop for many scenarios that could
be observed in a mine. Therefore, dynamic models within a reduced-order
framework were constructed to represent the transient-state combustion event.
Reduced order models (ROMs) reasonably replicate trends in temperature and
smoke, showing strong alignment with the ground-truth dataset.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Electrified Vehicles (CAEV) is the solution to the
future smart mobility having benefits of efficient traffic flow and cleaner
environmental impact. Although CAEV has advantages they are still susceptible
to adversarial cyber attacks due to their autonomous electric operation and the
involved connectivity. To alleviate this issue, we propose a secure control
architecture of CAEV. Particularly, we design an additional control input using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to be applied to the vehicle powertrain along with
the input commanded by the battery. We present simulation case studies to
demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach in keeping the CAEV platoon
operating safely without collisions by curbing the effect of adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sample-based moving horizon estimation (MHE)
scheme for general nonlinear systems to estimate the current system state using
irregularly and/or infrequently available measurements. The cost function of
the MHE optimization problem is suitably designed to accommodate these
irregular output sequences. We also establish that, under a suitable
sample-based detectability condition known as sample-based incremental
input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), the proposed sample-based MHE
achieves robust global exponential stability (RGES). Additionally, for the case
of linear systems, we draw connections between sample-based observability and
sample-based i-IOSS. This demonstrates that previously established conditions
for linear systems to be sample-based observable can be utilized to verify or
design sampling strategies that satisfy the conditions to guarantee RGES of the
sample-based MHE. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sample-based MHE
is illustrated through a simulation example.

approach uses a joint state vector with a single estimator, while the other
uses a dual-estimator scheme. We analyse their main characteristics, discussing

existing applications of these RL techniques across various PSE domains, such
as in fed-batch and continuous process control, process optimization, and

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pneumatic drying processes in industries such as agriculture, chemicals,and
pharmaceuticals are notoriously difficult to model and control due to
multi-source disturbances,coupled stage dynamics, and significant measurement
delays. Traditional modeling paradigms often fail to simultaneously deliver
accuracy, interpretability, and closed-loop applicability. To address this
challenge, this paper introduces a unified hybrid modeling framework, termed
Physics-Guided Residual Lifting with Control-Consistent Correction,which
integrates a transient mechanistic model with a stability-constrained
data-driven component. The framework covers the complete process chain of
drying, transport, and winnowing. On the mechanistic level, the model unifies
mass transfer dynamics using the partial pressure difference of water vapor,
incorporates water activity clamping and latent heat corrections for bound
water, and ensures energy closure with moisture-dependent specific heat. On the
data-driven level,we propose an orthogonal residual learning scheme. It
leverages intermediate states from the mechanistic model as proxy variables to
construct a physics-inspired dictionary, preventing parameter compensation and
overfitting during ridge regression. Furthermore, to ensure suitability for
predictive control, a Control-Consistent Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition
with stability constraints is employed to learn the residual dynamics, for
which we provide boundedness proofs and stability guarantees. The framework was
validated on 10 industrial batches, comprising 63,000 samples. On unseen test
data, the hybrid model achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 0.016% for outlet
moisture and 0.015 {\deg}C for outlet temperature, with values improving to
0.986 and 0.995, respectively. The resulting prediction residuals exhibit
white-noise characteristics, with significantly reduced spectral energy at low
frequencies.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and validation of a digital twin for a
scaled-down electric vehicle (EV) emulator, designed to replicate longitudinal
vehicle dynamics under diverse operating conditions. The emulator integrates a
separately excited DC motor (SEDCM), a four-quadrant DC-DC converter, a battery
emulator, and a mechanical load emulator. The system models tractive effort,
aerodynamic drag, and gradient resistance using Newton's second law. In
contrast to conventional graphical modeling tools (e.g., block diagrams and
bond graphs), the adopted Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) framework
offers clear advantages by explicitly representing energy interactions and
facilitating the systematic derivation of control structures. A control
strategy developed within this framework governs energy flow across the
powertrain, enabling accurate speed control via armature voltage regulation.
Experimental tests conducted on a Lucas-Nulle test bench show strong
correlation with simulation results. The study also introduces a methodology to
compute the maximum admissible vehicle mass - determined to be 13.5 kg for a
180 W motor operating at 1900 rpm - based on acceleration and slope
constraints. Furthermore, a switching algorithm for the bidirectional converter
ensures reliable four quadrant operation. Overall, the proposed framework
provides a scalable and effective approach for EV emulation, control design,
and energy management validation.

Abstract: Neural-network-based controllers (NNCs) can represent complex, highly
nonlinear control laws, but verifying the closed-loop stability of dynamical
systems using them remains challenging. This work presents contributions to a
state-of-the-art stability verification procedure for NNC-controlled systems
which relies on semialgebraic-set-based input-output modeling to pose the
search for a Lyapunov function as an optimization problem. Specifically, this
procedure's conservatism when analyzing NNCs using transcendental activation
functions and the restriction to feedforward NNCs are addressed by a)
introducing novel semialgebraic activation functions that preserve key
properties of common transcendental activations and b) proving compatibility of
NNCs from the broader class of recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs) with this
procedure. Furthermore, the indirect optimization of a local region of
attraction (RoA) estimate using a restricted set of candidate Lyapunov
functions is greatly improved via c) the introduction of a richer
parameterization of candidate Lyapunov functions than previously reported and
d) the formulation of novel semidefinite programs (SDPs) that directly optimize
the resulting RoA estimate. The value of these contributions is highlighted in
two numerical examples.

Abstract: Networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators are emerging as powerful physical
platforms for implementing Ising machines. Yet the relationship between
parametric-oscillator implementations and traditional oscillator-based Ising
machines remains underexplored. In this work, we develop a Kuramoto-style,
canonical phase description of parametric oscillator Ising machines by starting
from the Stuart-Landau oscillator model- the canonical normal form near a Hopf
bifurcation, and a natural reduced description for many parametric oscillator
implementations such as the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO)
among others. The resulting phase dynamics combine the usual phase-difference
coupling observed in the standard Kuramoto model along with an intrinsic phase
sum term that is generated when conjugate coupling is considered. Moreover, our
formulation helps explain why explicit second-harmonic driving is unnecessary
in parametric oscillators and also reveals how quasi-steady amplitude
heterogeneity scales the original strength of the spin interaction with
potentially adverse impacts on the solution quality. Our work helps develop a
unifying view of the oscillator-based approach to designing Ising machines.

Abstract: In modern display technology and visualization tools, downscaling images is
one of the most important activities. This procedure aims to maintain both
visual authenticity and structural integrity while reducing the dimensions of
an image at a large scale to fit the dimension of the display devices. In this
study, we proposed a new technique for downscaling images that uses
co-occurrence learning to maintain structural and perceptual information while
reducing resolution. The technique uses the input image to create a data-driven
co-occurrence profile that captures the frequency of intensity correlations in
nearby neighborhoods. A refined filtering process is guided by this profile,
which acts as a content-adaptive range kernel. The contribution of each input
pixel is based on how closely it resembles pair-wise intensity values with it's
neighbors. We validate our proposed technique on four datasets: DIV2K, BSD100,
Urban100, and RealSR to show its effective downscaling capacity. Our technique
could obtain up to 39.22 dB PSNR on the DIV2K dataset and PIQE up to 26.35 on
the same dataset when downscaling by 8x and 16x, respectively. Numerous
experimental findings attest to the ability of the suggested picture
downscaling method to outperform more contemporary approaches in terms of both
visual quality and performance measures. Unlike most existing methods, which
did not focus on the large-scale image resizing scenario, we achieve
high-quality downscaled images without texture loss or edge blurring. Our
method, LSID (large scale image downscaling), successfully preserves
high-frequency structures like edges, textures, and repeating patterns by
focusing on statistically consistent pixels while reducing aliasing and
blurring artifacts that are typical of traditional downscaling techniques.

Abstract: The inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several
other coupled-physics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms.
Such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional. In
addition, novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to
further improve such optimization approaches. All such methods require multiple
applications of the operator defining the forward problem, and of its adjoint.
In this paper, we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical
evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators, applicable in the circular
acquisition geometry. For an $(n \times n)$ image, our algorithms compute these
operators in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ floating point operations. We
demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical simulations, where
they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction
techniques: classic variational methods, such as non-negative least squares and
total variation regularized least squares, as well as deep learning methods,
such as learned primal dual. A Python implementation of our algorithms and
computational examples is available to the general public.

Abstract: Identifying and suppressing streaking artifacts is one of the most
challenging problems in quantitative susceptibility mapping. The measured phase
from tissue magnetization is assumed to be the convolution by the magnetic
dipole kernel; direct inversion or standard regularization methods tend to
create streaking artifacts in the estimated susceptibility. This is caused by
extreme noise and by the presence of non-dipolar phase contributions, which are
amplified by the dipole kernel following the streaking pattern. In this work,
we introduce a multiscale transform, called Dipole-lets, as an optimal
decomposition method for identifying dipole incompatibilities in measured field
data by extracting features of different characteristic size and orientation
with respect to the dipole kernel's zero-valued double-cone surface (the magic
cone). We provide experiments that showcase that non-dipolar content can be
extracted by Dipole-lets from phase data through artifact localization. We also
present implementations of Dipole-lets as a optimization functional
regularizator, through simple Tikhonov and infinity norm.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

Abstract: We study the generalized linear contextual bandit problem within the
constraints of limited adaptivity. In this paper, we present two algorithms,
$\texttt{B-GLinCB}$ and $\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$, that address, respectively, two
prevalent limited adaptivity settings. Given a budget $M$ on the number of
policy updates, in the first setting, the algorithm needs to decide upfront $M$
rounds at which it will update its policy, while in the second setting it can
adaptively perform $M$ policy updates during its course. For the first setting,
we design an algorithm $\texttt{B-GLinCB}$, that incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
regret when $M = \Omega( \log{\log T} )$ and the arm feature vectors are
generated stochastically. For the second setting, we design an algorithm
$\texttt{RS-GLinCB}$ that updates its policy $\tilde{O}(\log^2 T)$ times and
achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ even when the arm feature vectors
are adversarially generated. Notably, in these bounds, we manage to eliminate
the dependence on a key instance dependent parameter $\kappa$, that captures
non-linearity of the underlying reward model. Our novel approach for removing
this dependence for generalized linear contextual bandits might be of
independent interest.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where

confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially
explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant
mitigation assessment.

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed
rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of
compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

computational graphs with rich metadata, spanning six major task categories
across multiple deep learning frameworks. To evaluate tensor compiler
performance on these samples, we propose the benchmark metric Speedup Score
S(t), which jointly considers runtime speedup and execution correctness under
tunable tolerance levels, offering a reliable measure of general optimization
capability. Furthermore, we extend S(t) to the Error-aware Speedup Score ES(t),
which incorporates error information and helps compiler developers identify key
performance bottlenecks. In this report, we benchmark the default tensor

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is
available at https://github.com/iamkanghyunchoi/falqon.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial depen- dence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the
data-poor regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the num- ber of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algo- rithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Informa- tion Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, pro- viding the first
algorithm that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the
data-rich and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good
performance of SOIDS.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

considering censored data. Hyperparameter optimization was performed with
different samplers, and model performance was assessed using the Concordance
Index (C-Index), C-Index IPCW, time-dependent AUC, and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Survival curves produced by the models were compared with predictions
from classification algorithms, and predictor interpretation was conducted
using SHAP and permutation importance. XGB-AFT achieved the best performance
(C-Index = 0.7618; IPCW = 0.7532), followed by GBSA and RSF. The results

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock

treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Abstract: We are very delighted to see the fast development of physics-informed extreme
learning machine (PIELM) in recent years for higher computation efficiency and
accuracy in physics-informed machine learning. As a summary or review on PIELM
is currently not available, we would like to take this opportunity to show our
perspective and experience for this promising research direction. We can see
many efforts are made to solve PDEs with sharp gradients, nonlinearities,
high-frequency behavior, hard constraints, uncertainty, multiphysics coupling.
Despite the success, many urgent challenges remain to be tackled, which also
provides us opportunities to develop more robust, interpretable, and
generalizable PIELM frameworks with applications in science and engineering.

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length
weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game
playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive
accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Abstract: A/B testing has become the cornerstone of decision-making in online markets,
guiding how platforms launch new features, optimize pricing strategies, and
improve user experience. In practice, we typically employ the pairwise $t$-test
to compare outcomes between the treatment and control groups, thereby assessing
the effectiveness of a given strategy. To be trustworthy, these experiments
must keep Type I error (i.e., false positive rate) under control; otherwise, we
may launch harmful strategies. However, in real-world applications, we find
that A/B testing often fails to deliver reliable results. When the data
distribution departs from normality or when the treatment and control groups
differ in sample size, the commonly used pairwise $t$-test is no longer
trustworthy. In this paper, we quantify how skewed, long tailed data and
unequal allocation distort error rates and derive explicit formulas for the
minimum sample size required for the $t$-test to remain valid. We find that
many online feedback metrics require hundreds of millions samples to ensure
reliable A/B testing. Thus we introduce an Edgeworth-based correction that
provides more accurate $p$-values when the available sample size is limited.
Offline experiments on a leading A/B testing platform corroborate the practical
value of our theoretical minimum sample size thresholds and demonstrate that
the corrected method substantially improves the reliability of A/B testing in
real-world conditions.

Abstract: Variational mean field approximations tend to struggle with contemporary
overparametrized deep neural networks. Where a Bayesian treatment is usually
associated with high-quality predictions and uncertainties, the practical
reality has been the opposite, with unstable training, poor predictive power,
and subpar calibration. Building upon recent work on reparametrizations of
neural networks, we propose a simple variational family that considers two
independent linear subspaces of the parameter space. These represent functional
changes inside and outside the support of training data. This allows us to
build a fully-correlated approximate posterior reflecting the
overparametrization that tunes easy-to-interpret hyperparameters. We develop
scalable numerical routines that maximize the associated evidence lower bound
(ELBO) and sample from the approximate posterior. Empirically, we observe
state-of-the-art performance across tasks, models, and datasets compared to a
wide array of baseline methods. Our results show that approximate Bayesian
inference applied to deep neural networks is far from a lost cause when
constructing inference mechanisms that reflect the geometry of
reparametrizations.

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty in the output of a neural network is essential
for deployment in scientific or engineering applications where decisions must
be made under limited or noisy data. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a
framework for this purpose by constructing a Bayesian posterior distribution
over the network parameters. However, the prior, which is of key importance in
any Bayesian setting, is rarely meaningful for BNNs. This is because the
complexity of the input-to-output map of a BNN makes it difficult to understand
how certain distributions enforce any interpretable constraint on the output
space. Gaussian processes (GPs), on the other hand, are often preferred in
uncertainty quantification tasks due to their interpretability. The drawback is
that GPs are limited to small datasets without advanced techniques, which often
rely on the covariance kernel having a specific structure. To address these
challenges, we introduce a new class of priors for BNNs, called Mercer priors,
such that the resulting BNN has samples which approximate that of a specified
GP. The method works by defining a prior directly over the network parameters
from the Mercer representation of the covariance kernel, and does not rely on
the network having a specific structure. In doing so, we can exploit the
scalability of BNNs in a meaningful Bayesian way.

Abstract: Machine learning models have achieved widespread success but often inherit
and amplify historical biases, resulting in unfair outcomes. Traditional
fairness methods typically impose constraints at the prediction level, without
addressing underlying biases in data representations. In this work, we propose
a principled framework that adjusts data representations to balance predictive
utility and fairness. Using sufficient dimension reduction, we decompose the
feature space into target-relevant, sensitive, and shared components, and
control the fairness-utility trade-off by selectively removing sensitive
information. We provide a theoretical analysis of how prediction error and
fairness gaps evolve as shared subspaces are added, and employ influence
functions to quantify their effects on the asymptotic behavior of parameter
estimates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our
theoretical insights and show that the proposed method effectively improves
fairness while preserving predictive performance.

Abstract: Score-based generative models based on stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) achieve impressive performance in sampling from unknown distributions,
but often fail to satisfy underlying constraints. We propose a constrained
generative model using kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics with specular
reflection of velocity on the boundary defining constraints. This results in
piecewise continuously differentiable noising and denoising process where the
latter is characterized by a time-reversed dynamics restricted to a domain with
boundary due to specular boundary condition. In addition, we also contribute to
existing reflected SDEs based constrained generative models, where the
stochastic dynamics is restricted through an abstract local time term. By
presenting efficient numerical samplers which converge with optimal rate in
terms of discretizations step, we provide a comprehensive comparison of models
based on confined (specularly reflected kinetic) Langevin diffusion with models
based on reflected diffusion with local time.

Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have become a principal tool for
goodness-of-fit testing, but standard KSDs are often insensitive to
higher-order dependency structures, such as tail dependence, which are critical
in many scientific and financial domains. We address this gap by introducing
the Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD), a novel class of discrepancies tailored to
the geometry of statistical dependence. By defining a Stein operator directly
on the copula density, CSD leverages the generative structure of dependence,
rather than relying on the joint density's score function. For the broad class
of Archimedean copulas, this approach yields a closed-form Stein kernel derived
from the scalar generator function. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
analysis, proving that CSD (i) metrizes weak convergence of copula
distributions, ensuring it detects any mismatch in dependence; (ii) has an
empirical estimator that converges at the minimax optimal rate of
$O_P(n^{-1/2})$; and (iii) is provably sensitive to differences in tail
dependence coefficients. The framework is extended to general non-Archimedean
copulas, including elliptical and vine copulas. Computationally, the exact CSD
kernel evaluation scales linearly in dimension, while a novel random feature
approximation reduces the $n$-dependence from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to near-linear
$\tilde{O}(n)$, making CSD a practical and theoretically principled tool for
dependence-aware inference.

Abstract: We study the adversarial linear bandits problem and present a unified

Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) methods, extending the known connection
between them from the full-information setting. Within this framework, we
introduce self-concordant perturbations, a family of probability distributions
that mirror the role of self-concordant barriers previously employed in the
FTRL-based SCRiBLe algorithm. Using this idea, we design a novel FTPL-based
algorithm that combines self-concordant regularization with efficient
stochastic exploration. Our approach achieves a regret of $O(d\sqrt{n \ln n})$
on both the $d$-dimensional hypercube and the Euclidean ball. On the Euclidean
ball, this matches the rate attained by existing self-concordant FTRL methods.
For the hypercube, this represents a $\sqrt{d}$ improvement over these methods
and matches the optimal bound up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to
analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to
tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going
beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively
answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer
perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it
more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive
than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the
challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and
data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider
the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of
learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the
sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network
as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various
learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through
model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for
training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by
the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating
from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer.
Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the
Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and
finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning
regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Abstract: While Generative AI rapidly advances in various domains, generating truly
creative, aesthetic, and counter-intuitive outputs remains a challenge. This
paper presents an approach to tackle these difficulties in the domain of chess
puzzles. We start by benchmarking Generative AI architectures, and then
introduce an RL framework with novel rewards based on chess engine search
statistics to overcome some of those shortcomings. The rewards are designed to
enhance a puzzle's uniqueness, counter-intuitiveness, diversity, and realism.
Our RL approach dramatically increases counter-intuitive puzzle generation by
10x, from 0.22\% (supervised) to 2.5\%, surpassing existing dataset rates
(2.1\%) and the best Lichess-trained model (0.4\%). Our puzzles meet novelty
and diversity benchmarks, retain aesthetic themes, and are rated by human
experts as more creative, enjoyable, and counter-intuitive than composed book
puzzles, even approaching classic compositions. Our final outcome is a curated
booklet of these AI-generated puzzles, which is acknowledged for creativity by
three world-renowned experts.

both traditional and AI-driven controllers. Using a miniature greenhouse as a
test platform, four predictive models Linear, Physics-Based Modeling (PBM),
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) are
developed and compared under interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. Three
control strategies Model Predictive Control (MPC), Reinforcement Learning (RL),
and Large Language Model (LLM) based control are also implemented to assess
trade-offs in precision, adaptability, and implementation effort. Results show
that in modeling HAM provides the most balanced performance across accuracy,
generalization, and computational efficiency, while LSTM achieves high
precision at greater resource cost. Among controllers, MPC delivers robust and
predictable performance, RL demonstrates strong adaptability, and LLM-based
controllers offer flexible human-AI interaction when coupled with predictive

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach

diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a

It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform
complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding
Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited. Existing MCP
research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks
training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven
pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training.
MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing
68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far
exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call
generation, and enhanced agentic task performance. MCP-Flow thus provides a
scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP
environments. MCP-Flow is publicly available at

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have

mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation

legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Agentic tool use has gained traction with the rise of agentic tool calling,
yet most existing work overlooks the complexity of multi-turn tool
interactions. We introduce OrchDAG, a synthetic data generation pipeline that
models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable
complexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a
graph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset
presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is
effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance
of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.
