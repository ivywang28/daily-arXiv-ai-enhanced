Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across

Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise

striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents a conformal prediction method for classification in
highly imbalanced and open-set settings, where there are many possible classes
and not all may be represented in the data. Existing approaches require a
finite, known label space and typically involve random sample splitting, which
works well when there is a sufficient number of observations from each class.
Consequently, they have two limitations: (i) they fail to provide adequate
coverage when encountering new labels at test time, and (ii) they may become
overly conservative when predicting previously seen labels. To obtain valid
prediction sets in the presence of unseen labels, we compute and integrate into
our predictions a new family of conformal p-values that can test whether a new
data point belongs to a previously unseen class. We study these p-values
theoretically, establishing their optimality, and uncover an intriguing
connection with the classical Good--Turing estimator for the probability of
observing a new species. To make more efficient use of imbalanced data, we also
develop a selective sample splitting algorithm that partitions training and
calibration data based on label frequency, leading to more informative
predictions. Despite breaking exchangeability, this allows maintaining
finite-sample guarantees through suitable re-weighting. With both simulated and
real data, we demonstrate our method leads to prediction sets with valid
coverage even in challenging open-set scenarios with infinite numbers of
possible labels, and produces more informative predictions under extreme class
imbalance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to efficiently remove the influence of selected data
while preserving generalization. Significant progress has been made in low
dimensions $(p \ll n)$, but high dimensions pose serious theoretical challenges
as standard optimization assumptions of $\Omega(1)$ strong convexity and $O(1)$
smoothness of the per-example loss $f$ rarely hold simultaneously in
proportional regimes $(p\sim n)$. In this work, we introduce
$\varepsilon$-Gaussian certifiability, a canonical and robust notion
well-suited to high-dimensional regimes, that optimally captures a broad class
of noise adding mechanisms. Then we theoretically analyze the performance of a
widely used unlearning algorithm based on one step of the Newton method in the
high-dimensional setting described above. Our analysis shows that a single
Newton step, followed by a well-calibrated Gaussian noise, is sufficient to
achieve both privacy and accuracy in this setting. This result stands in sharp
contrast to the only prior work that analyzes machine unlearning in high
dimensions \citet{zou2025certified}, which relaxes some of the standard
optimization assumptions for high-dimensional applicability, but operates under
the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability. That work concludes %that a single
Newton step is insufficient even for removing a single data point, and that at
least two steps are required to ensure both privacy and accuracy. Our result
leads us to conclude that the discrepancy in the number of steps arises because
of the sub optimality of the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability and its
incompatibility with noise adding mechanisms, which $\varepsilon$-Gaussian
certifiability is able to overcome optimally.

Abstract: In highly nonlinear systems such as the ones commonly found in astrodynamics,
Gaussian distributions generally evolve into non-Gaussian distributions. This
paper introduces a method for effectively controlling non-Gaussian
distributions in nonlinear environments using optimized linear feedback
control. This paper utilizes Conjugate Unscented Transformation to quantify the
higher-order statistical moments of non-Gaussian distributions. The formulation
focuses on controlling and constraining the sigma points associated with the
uncertainty quantification, which would thereby reflect the control of the
entire distribution and constraints on the moments themselves. This paper
develops an algorithm to solve this problem with sequential convex programming,
and it is demonstrated through a two-body and three-body example. The examples
show that individual moments can be directly controlled, and the moments are
accurately approximated for non-Gaussian distributions throughout the
controller's time horizon in nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: Cloud-assisted system identification and control have emerged as practical
solutions for low-power, resource-constrained control systems such as
micro-UAVs. In a typical cloud-assisted setting, state and input data are
transmitted from local agents to a central computer over low-bandwidth wireless
links, leading to quantization. This paper investigates the impact of state and
input data quantization on a linear time invariant (LTI) system identification,
derives a worst-case bound on the identification error, and develops a robust
controller for guaranteed cost control. We establish a fundamental bound on the
model error that depends only on the quantized data and quantization
resolution, and develop a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based guaranteed cost
robust controller under this error bound.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems, critical for safety, require real-time guarantees
and can be modeled as DAGs. Their acceleration features, such as caches and
pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a
probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability
threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This
paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results
of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively
more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task
set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned
scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates
that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis
time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The
evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric
Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.

Abstract: The growing integration of distributed renewable generation and the
electrification of heating and transportation are rapidly increasing the number
of flexible devices within modern distribution grids. Leveraging the aggregated
flexibility of these small-scale distributed resources is essential to
maintaining future grid-wide stability. This work uses the Swiss distribution
grid of Walenstadt as a case study to provide insights into the aggregated
flexibility potential of distribution grids. It demonstrates that incorporating
devices such as heat pumps and photovoltaic systems significantly enhances
distribution grid flexibility. It investigates the time-varying nature of
aggregated flexibility and highlights how it can vary seasonally. Furthermore,
simulations of future scenarios reveal that aggregated flexibility does not
increase linearly or monotonically with higher levels of flexible device
penetration. This is primarily due to the overloading of individual feeders,
which underscores the impact of grid topology and network constraints on the
aggregated flexibility potential.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of vehicle collision dynamics is crucial for advanced
safety systems and post-impact control applications, yet existing methods face
inherent trade-offs among computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and
data requirements. This paper proposes a dual Physics-Informed Neural Network
framework addressing these challenges through two complementary networks. The
first network integrates Gaussian Mixture Models with PINN architecture to
learn impact force distributions from finite element analysis data while
enforcing momentum conservation and energy consistency constraints. The second
network employs an adaptive PINN with dynamic constraint weighting to predict
post-collision vehicle dynamics, featuring an adaptive physics guard layer that
prevents unrealistic predictions whil e preserving data-driven learning
capabilities. The framework incorporates uncertainty quantification through
time-varying parameters and enables rapid adaptation via fine-tuning
strategies. Validation demonstrates significant improvements: the impact force
model achieves relative errors below 15.0% for force prediction on finite
element analysis (FEA) datasets, while the vehicle dynamics model reduces
average trajectory prediction error by 63.6% compared to traditional
four-degree-of-freedom models in scaled vehicle experiments. The integrated
system maintains millisecond-level computational efficiency suitable for
real-time applications while providing probabilistic confidence bounds
essential for safety-critical control. Comprehensive validation through FEA
simulation, dynamic modeling, and scaled vehicle experiments confirms the
framework's effectiveness for Precision Immobilization Technique scenarios and
general collision dynamics prediction.

Abstract: The transition to a fully decarbonised electricity system depends on
integrating new technologies that ensure reliability alongside sustainability.
However, missing risk markets hinder investment in reliability-enhancing
technologies by exposing investors to revenue uncertainty. This study provides
the first quantitative assessment of how missing risk markets affect investment
decisions in power systems that depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES)
for reliability. We develop a two-stage stochastic equilibrium model with
risk-averse market participants, which independently sizes power and energy
capacity. We apply the method to a case study of a deeply decarbonised power
system in Great Britain. The results show that incomplete risk markets reduce
social welfare, harm reliability, and discourage investment in LDES and other
technologies with volatile revenue streams. Revenue volatility leads to
substantial risk premiums and higher financing costs for LDES, creating a
barrier to its large-scale deployment. These findings demonstrate the
importance of policy mechanisms that hedge revenue risk to lower the cost of
capital and accelerate investment in reliability-enhancing, zero-carbon
technologies

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud
models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and
unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a
delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays,
allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our
method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and
fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On
video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic
segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only
baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms.
Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared
to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a
round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and
higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more
effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain
aligned with the current world state.
