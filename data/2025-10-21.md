Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and

various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Abstract: Mapping agriculture in tropical areas through remote sensing presents unique
challenges, including the lack of high-quality annotated data, the elevated
costs of labeling, data variability, and regional generalisation. This paper
advocates a Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) perspective and
pipeline, emphasizing data quality and curation as key drivers for model
robustness and scalability. It reviews and prioritizes techniques such as
confident learning, core-set selection, data augmentation, and active learning.
The paper highlights the readiness and suitability of 25 distinct strategies in
large-scale agricultural mapping pipelines. The tropical context is of high
interest, since high cloudiness, diverse crop calendars, and limited datasets
limit traditional model-centric approaches. This tutorial outlines practical
solutions as a data-centric approach for curating and training AI models better
suited to the dynamic realities of tropical agriculture. Finally, we propose a
practical pipeline using the 9 most mature and straightforward methods that can
be applied to a large-scale tropical agricultural mapping project.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
video analytics.

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale,

diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning
models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification
cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a
range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation
layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and
anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative
skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene
segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a
domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model
on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out
center. The dataset and annotations are available in Google Form

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in

humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5
CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on
compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code
is available at https://github.com/iamjaekyun/vipamin.

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a
deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple
imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system
integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet,
and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including
model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables
flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures,
ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR.
Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code
are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as

point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to

expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible
accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image
resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic
performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness -
whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain

accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving
and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard
conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LongInsightBench}, the first benchmark designed to
assess models' ability to understand long videos, with a focus on human
language, viewpoints, actions, and other contextual elements, while integrating
\textbf{visual, audio, and text} modalities. Our benchmark excels in three key
areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select
approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on
duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities,
focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich
language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have
designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and
Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance
Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality
assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized
questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series
of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still
face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and
long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the
information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos

However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of

this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains

(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings.
  Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy. CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank
Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss, while using less energy.
VLMs remain favorable for contextual reasoning and multimodal inference. We
quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions across training and inference, and analyze
sustainability trade-offs for deployment.
  To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics.
  These findings support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine
classification, with selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive
scenarios. The resulting framework offers a reproducible baseline for
responsible, resource-aware AI in video surveillance, with extensions toward
real-time, multimodal, and lifecycle-aware systems.

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or
labels. Code and pruned models are available at: https://elastic.ashita.nl/

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has

existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video
understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues.
Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that
focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated
multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously
aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and
multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we
extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available
to foster future research.

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

tomography (CT). Despite the integration of machine learning and deep learning
methods, the predictive efficacy of automated systems for lung cancer
classification from CT images remains below the desired threshold for clinical
adoption. Existing research predominantly focuses on binary classification,
distinguishing between malignant and benign lung nodules. In this study, a
novel deep learning-based approach is introduced, aimed at an improved
multi-class classification, discerning various subtypes of lung cancer from CT
images. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet model, lung tissue images were
classified into three distinct classes, two of which denote malignancy and one
benign. Employing a dataset comprising 15,000 lung CT images sourced from the
LC25000 histopathological images, the ResNet50 model was trained on 10,200
images, validated on 2,550 images, and tested on the remaining 2,250 images.
Through the incorporation of custom layers atop the ResNet architecture and
meticulous hyperparameter fine-tuning, a remarkable test accuracy of 98.8% was
recorded. This represents a notable enhancement over the performance of prior
models on the same dataset.

Abstract: Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized
least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These
approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations,
typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for
regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable
parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the
proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce
artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using
distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the
number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting.
To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators
with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of
time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm
unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel
perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP)
and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling,
framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights
in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast
as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the
fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate
that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise
amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show
that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling
approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the
computational complexity significantly.

Abstract: Current spinal pain management procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) and epidural steroid injection (ESI), rely on fluoroscopy for needle
placement which exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. In this
paper, we investigate a radiation-free surgical navigation system for spinal
pain management procedures that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with
fiducial ArUco marker-based augmented reality (AR). High-resolution MRI scans
of a lumbar spinal phantom were obtained and assembled as a surface mesh.
Laplacian smoothing algorithms were then applied to smoothen the surface and
improve the model fidelity. A commercially available stereo camera (ZED2) was
used to track single or dual fiducial ArUco markers on the patient to determine
the patient's real-time pose. Custom AR software was applied to overlay the MRI
image onto the patient, allowing the physician to see not only the outer
surface of the patient but also the complete anatomy of the patient below the
surface. Needle-insertion trials on a 3D-printed 3-vertebra phantom showed that
dual-ArUco marker tracking increased the accuracy of needle insertions and
reduced the average needle misplacement distance compared to single-ArUco
marker procedures. The average needle misplacement is comparable to the average
deviation of 2 mm for conventional epidural techniques using fluoroscopy. Our
radiation-free system demonstrates promise to serve as an alternative to
fluoroscopy by improving image-guided spinal navigation.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image captioning enables scene-level semantic

intelligence and urban planning, but its development is limited by the scarcity
of high-quality datasets. To address this, we present FSAR-Cap, a large-scale
SAR captioning dataset with 14,480 images and 72,400 image-text pairs. FSAR-Cap
is built on the FAIR-CSAR detection dataset and constructed through a two-stage
annotation strategy that combines hierarchical template-based representation,
manual verification and supplementation, prompt standardization. Compared with
existing resources, FSAR-Cap provides richer fine-grained annotations, broader
category coverage, and higher annotation quality. Benchmarking with multiple
encoder-decoder architectures verifies its effectiveness, establishing a
foundation for future research in SAR captioning and intelligent image
interpretation.

Abstract: Effective image deblurring typically relies on large and fully paired
datasets of blurred and corresponding sharp images. However, obtaining such
accurately aligned data in the real world poses a number of difficulties,
limiting the effectiveness and generalizability of existing deblurring methods.
To address this scarcity of data dependency, we present a novel dictionary
learning based deblurring approach for jointly estimating a structured blur
matrix and a high resolution image dictionary. This framework enables robust
image deblurring across different degrees of data supervision. Our method is
thoroughly evaluated across three distinct experimental settings: (i) full
supervision involving paired data with explicit correspondence, (ii) partial
supervision employing unpaired data with implicit relationships, and (iii)
unsupervised learning using non-correspondence data where direct pairings are
absent. Extensive experimental validation, performed on synthetically blurred
subsets of the CMU-Cornell iCoseg dataset and the real-world FocusPath dataset,
consistently shows that the proposed framework has superior performance
compared to conventional coupled dictionary learning approaches. The results
validate that our approach provides an efficient and robust solution for image
deblurring in data-constrained scenarios by enabling accurate blur modeling and
adaptive dictionary representation with a notably smaller number of training
samples.

Abstract: Depth-image-based rendering is a key view synthesis algorithm in 3D video
systems, which enables the synthesis of virtual views from texture images and
depth maps. An efficient view synthesis distortion estimation model is critical
for optimizing resource allocation in real-time applications such as
interactive free-viewpoint video and 3D video streaming services. However,
existing estimation methods are often computationally intensive, require
parameter training, or performance poorly in challenging large baseline
configurations. This paper presents a novel, low-complexity, and training-free
method to accurately estimate the distortion of synthesized views without
performing the actual rendering process. Key contributions include: (1) A joint
texture-depth classification method that accurately separates texture image
into locally stationary and non-stationary regions, which mitigates
misclassifications by using texture-only methods. (2) A novel baseline distance
indicator is designed for the compensation scheme for distortions caused by
large baseline configurations. (3) A region-based blending estimation strategy
that geometrically identifies overlapping, single-view, and mutual disocclusion
regions, predicting distortion in synthesized views from two reference views
with differing synthesis conditions. Experiments on standard MPEG 3D video
sequences validate the proposed method's high accuracy and efficiency,
especially in large baseline configurations. This method enables more flexible
camera arrangements in 3D content acquisition by accurately predicting
synthesis quality under challenging geometric configurations.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of motion vectors extracted from
AV1-encoded video streams and their application in accelerating optical flow
estimation. We demonstrate that motion vectors from AV1 video codec can serve
as a high-quality and computationally efficient substitute for traditional
optical flow, a critical but often resource-intensive component in many
computer vision pipelines. Our primary contributions are twofold. First, we
provide a detailed comparison of motion vectors from both AV1 and HEVC against
ground-truth optical flow, establishing their fidelity. In particular we show
the impact of encoder settings on motion estimation fidelity and make
recommendations about the optimal settings. Second, we show that using these
extracted AV1 motion vectors as a "warm-start" for a state-of-the-art deep
learning-based optical flow method, RAFT, significantly reduces the time to
convergence while achieving comparable accuracy. Specifically, we observe a
four-fold speedup in computation time with only a minor trade- off in end-point
error. These findings underscore the potential of reusing motion vectors from
compressed video as a practical and efficient method for a wide range of
motion-aware computer vision applications.

Abstract: Early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders relies on accurate
segmentation of brain structures in infancy, a task complicated by rapid brain
growth, poor tissue contrast, and motion artifacts in pediatric MRI. These
challenges are further exacerbated in ultra-low-field (ULF, 0.064~T) MRI,
which, despite its lower image quality, offers an affordable, portable, and
sedation-free alternative for use in low-resource settings. In this work, we
propose a domain randomization (DR) framework to bridge the domain gap between
high-field (HF) and ULF MRI in the context of the hippocampi and basal ganglia
segmentation in the LISA challenge. We show that pre-training on whole-brain HF
segmentations using DR significantly improves generalization to ULF data, and
that careful curation of training labels, by removing misregistered HF-to-ULF
annotations from training, further boosts performance. By fusing the
predictions of several models through majority voting, we are able to achieve
competitive performance. Our results demonstrate that combining robust
augmentation with annotation quality control can enable accurate segmentation
in ULF data. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential
preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader
ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks
adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented
role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development,
we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that
addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive
process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a
trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and
schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible
memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design
a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic
reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO
benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks,
confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing
adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level
interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory
in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions
that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs
as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t,
\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and
\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies
such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and
decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization
methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of
reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that
CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided
interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining
accuracy.

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are
open-sourced to encourage further progress at

research data in sports science, particularly in the field of motor performance
research. In this paper, we present our vision for creating a knowledge graph
from MO|RE data. With an ontology rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology, our
approach centers on formally representing the interrelation of plan
specifications, specific processes, and related measurements. Our goal is to
transform how motor performance data are modeled and shared across studies,
making it standardized and machine-understandable. The idea presented here is
developed within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems,
while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a
progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real
systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state,
thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of
neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to
the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins
(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical
systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model
the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are
predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical
analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models
generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging
two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that
PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements
with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing
neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation
and decision-making.

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code
are available at https://github.com/JYREN-Source/ISGFAN

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping
with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability,
and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when
reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.
This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with
online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible
under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible
job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to
obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a
Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic
controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime
activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or
deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4
benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline
violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding
only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP
solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The
work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between
proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to
truly digital, self-correcting factories.

scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling
the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI
de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert
annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection
framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure
de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy
reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each
independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting
structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based
majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a
single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical
note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate
rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting
reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with
ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's
automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining
independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a
practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and
best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels
are limited.

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while
violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG,
a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to
enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG
encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the
verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee
consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG
improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields
1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how
MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user
experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems,
however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it
difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral
consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily
focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill
latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits
the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized
interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To
realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in
LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the
ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework
enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts
semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical
coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a
dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in
modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression
and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles
from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may
be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture
(VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming
language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are
encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative
memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the
Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the
embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types
of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are
therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,
1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or
program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may
therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a
form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill
acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),
exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;
Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling
human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and
those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence
(UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex
urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit
persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited
generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement
learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of
UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize
reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a
proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive
experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively
mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both
SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement
learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy
urban intelligence.

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language

knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned
interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It
contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable
benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an
extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM
agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On
eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities
for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP,
yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent
populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades
(Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling),
and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves
coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly
handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a
protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the
emerging Internet of Agents

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse
research applications is provided.

Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge,
demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm
design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward
automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which
restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution
feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with
LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full
automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge
from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted
modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the
overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized
agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and
logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from
standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against
meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms
existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility,
achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial
intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but
act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building
agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory
are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,
where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We
first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling
this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to
outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task
across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey
systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --
has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.
Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent
applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon
reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by
discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like
Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the
system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments
outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated
learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing
systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence
through experience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven
engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with
optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two
central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration
requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and
reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a
workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on
compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency
approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every
simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design
to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we
proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using
surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The
methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect
and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency
of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy
and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the
approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis
of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.
Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale
exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,
identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates
require more data or alternative architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that
enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to
Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet
optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex
interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and
hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing
approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement
tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel
optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel
optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent
collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic
search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs
to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine
kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for
LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often
fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These
results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully
automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning
remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative
non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes
yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical
prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required
in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two
operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate
structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a
non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis
through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based
multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification
through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's
critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate
cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to
manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains
(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The
KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median
ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.
3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured
multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in
financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit
assessment.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but
faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data
integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.
Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across
various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is
time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in
functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on
static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step
reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a
reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical
support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.
Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.
Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism
that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data
sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of
dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We
evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and
user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show
that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base
model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with
participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto
platforms (4.62/5).

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
coordination problems.

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97
points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web
retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific
training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled
data remains scarce.

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on
empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ
multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the
above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to
analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new
interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that
is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance
can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference
technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the
targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class
of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary
task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the
corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance
graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning
paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted
intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.

Abstract: A general and psychologically plausible collision avoidance driver model can
improve transportation safety significantly. Most computational driver models
found in the literature have used control theory methods only, and they are not
established based on psychological theories. In this paper, a unified approach
is presented based on concepts taken from psychology and control theory. The
"task difficulty homeostasis theory", a prominent motivational theory, is
combined with the "Lyapunov stability method" in control theory to present a
general and psychologically plausible model. This approach is used to model
driver steering behavior for collision avoidance. The performance of this model
is measured by simulation of two collision avoidance scenarios at a wide range
of speeds from 20 km/h to 170 km/h. The model is validated by experiments on a
driving simulator. The results demonstrate that the model follows human
behavior accurately with a mean error of 7 percent.

Abstract: This article presents an overview and analysis of spatial-to-spectral
harmonic-modulated arrays (SHAs). Compared to traditional analog or digital
beamforming arrays, SHAs enable concurrent multi-beamforming without requiring
substantial hardware replication. SHAs replace the need for hardware
replication with frequency-domain multiplexing. Furthermore, SHAs have the
potential to become key contributors to future 6G networks by enabling scalable
multi-user communications, joint communication and sensing, and spatial
interference mitigation. In addition, an analysis of the SHA's
harmonic-modulation waveform and its effects on gain, noise and bandwidth is
presented. A comb-like modulation waveform for SHAs that minimizes spectral
inefficiency is proposed. Further, an analysis of the SHA's capability to
independently steer multiple beams is presented. This capability is quantified
in terms of the SHA's spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom. Lastly, this work
introduces a novel SHA architecture that provides three spatial-to-spectral
degrees of freedom with minimal hardware replication.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of modern manufacturing systems is driven by the
integration of emerging metaverse technologies such as artificial intelligence
(AI), digital twin (DT) with different forms of extended reality (XR) like
virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). These
advances confront manufacturing workers with complex and evolving environments
that demand digital literacy for problem solving in the future workplace.
However, manufacturing industry faces a critical shortage of skilled workforce
with digital literacy in the world. Further, global pandemic has significantly
changed how people work and collaborate digitally and remotely. There is an
urgent need to rethink digital platformization and leverage emerging
technologies to propel industrial evolution toward human-centered manufacturing
metaverse (MfgVerse). This paper presents a forward-looking perspective on the
development of smart MfgVerse, highlighting current efforts in learning
factory, cognitive digital twinning, and the new sharing economy of
manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS). MfgVerse is converging into multiplex
networks, including a social network of human stakeholders, an interconnected
network of manufacturing things or agents (e.g., machines, robots, facilities,
material handling systems), a network of digital twins of physical things, as
well as auxiliary networks of sales, supply chain, logistics, and
remanufacturing systems. We also showcase the design and development of a
learning factory for workforce training in extended reality. Finally, future
directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed for human-centered
manufacturing metaverse. We hope this work helps stimulate more comprehensive
studies and in-depth research efforts to advance MfgVerse technologies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed
of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing
conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become
nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in
time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay
settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC
nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to
restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive
UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear
network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions.
We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed
multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable
MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables
into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We
solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces
near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple
synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to
networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary
decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions
that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.

Abstract: This research investigates designing a supervisory feedback controller for a
hybrid power plant that coordinates the wind, solar, and battery energy storage
plants to meet the desired power demands. We have explored an online feedback
control design that does not require detailed knowledge about the models, known
as feedback optimization. The control inputs are updated using the gradient
information of the cost and the outputs with respect to the input control
commands. This enables us to adjust the active power references of wind, solar,
and storage plants to meet the power generation requirements set by grid
operators. The methodology also ensures robust control performance in the
presence of uncertainties in the weather. In this paper, we focus on describing
the supervisory feedback optimization formulation and control-oriented modeling
for individual renewable and storage components of the hybrid power plant. The
proposed supervisory control has been integrated with the hybrid plant
co-simulation engine, Hercules, demonstrating its effectiveness in more
realistic simulation scenarios.

Abstract: The secure operation of power distribution systems is challenged by the
growing integration of distributed energy resources. Leveraging the flexibility
of battery storage offers a cost-effective alternative to measures like
generation curtailment, which results in energy losses. However, developing an
effective operational model for battery storage is hindered by inaccurate grid
models, unavailability of load data, nonlinear relationship between power
injections and network states, intertemporal constraints, and complex
electrochemical and thermal dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a data-driven operational control scheme for battery storage in
distribution systems. Linear and convex quadratic operational constraints are
constructed based on real-time distribution system and battery storage
measurements. Lyapunov optimization decouples multi-period battery operation,
enabling a real-time, forecast-free control strategy with low computational
complexity. Numerical studies using nonlinear distribution system and battery
storage simulators validate the effectiveness of the approach in ensuring
secure distribution system operation and satisfaction of voltage and thermal
constraints of battery storage.

Abstract: In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the frequent transmission of
large amounts of data over wireless networks should meet the stringent
timeliness requirements. Particularly, the freshness of packet status updates
has a significant impact on the system performance. In this paper, we propose
an age-of-information (AoI)-aware multi-base station (BS) real-time monitoring
framework to support extensive IIoT deployments. To meet the freshness
requirements of IIoT, we formulate a joint task offloading and resource
allocation optimization problem with the goal of minimizing long-term average
AoI. Tackling the core challenges of combinatorial explosion in multi-BS
decision spaces and the stochastic dynamics of IIoT systems is crucial, as
these factors render traditional optimization methods intractable. Firstly, an
innovative branching-based Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (Branching-D3QN)
algorithm is proposed to effectively implement task offloading, which optimizes
the convergence performance by reducing the action space complexity from
exponential to linear levels. Then, an efficient optimization solution to
resource allocation is proposed by proving the semi-definite property of the
Hessian matrix of bandwidth and computation resources. Finally, we propose an
iterative optimization algorithm for efficient joint task offloading and
resource allocation to achieve optimal average AoI performance. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that our proposed Branching-D3QN algorithm outperforms
both state-of-the-art DRL methods and classical heuristics, achieving up to a
75% enhanced convergence speed and at least a 22% reduction in the long-term
average AoI.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for stabilizing nonlinear systems
represented in state-dependent form. We first reformulate the nonlinear
dynamics as a state-dependent parameter-varying model and synthesize a
stabilizing controller offline via tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
The resulting controller guarantees local exponential stability, maintains
robustness against disturbances, and provides an estimate of the region of
attraction under input saturation. We then extend the formulation to the direct
data-driven setting, where a known library of basis functions represents the
dynamics with unknown coefficients consistent with noisy experimental data. By
leveraging Petersen's lemma, we derive data-dependent LMIs that ensure
stability and robustness for all systems compatible with the data. Numerical
and physical experimental results validate that our approach achieves rigorous
end-to-end guarantees on stability, robustness, and safety directly from finite
data without explicit model identification.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to perform small-signal stability analysis
based on linearization of implicit multilinear models. Multilinear models
describe the system dynamics by multilinear functions of state, input, and
algebraic variables. Using suitable transformations of variables, they can also
represent trigonometric functions, which often occur in power systems modeling.
This allows tensor representations of grid-following and grid-forming power
converters. This paper introduces small-signal stability analysis of
equilibrium points based on implicit multilinear models using generalized
eigenvalues. The generalized eigenvalues are computed from linear descriptor
models of the linearized implicit multilinear model. The proposed approach is
tested using a 3-bus network example, first by comparing time-domain
simulations of the implicit multilinear model with those of the nonlinear
model, and second by comparing the generalized eigenvalues with those of the
linearized nonlinear model. The results show that the decomposed tensor
representation of the implicit multilinear model allows for a faster
linearization compared to conventional methods in MATLAB Simulink.

Abstract: In post--layout circuit simulation, efficient model order reduction (MOR) for
many--port resistor--capacitor (RC) circuits remains a crucial issue. The
current mainstream MOR methods for such circuits include high--order moment
matching methods and elimination methods. High-order moment matching
methods--characterized by high accuracy, such as PRIMA and TurboMOR--tend to
generate large dense reduced-order systems when the number of ports is large,
which impairs the efficiency of MOR. Another common type of MOR method for
many--port circuits is based on Gaussian elimination, with the SIP method as a
representative. The main limitation of this method lies in the inadequate
matching of high--order moments. In this paper, we propose a sparse multipoint
moment matching method and present comprehensive theoretical analysis results
regarding the multi--frequency high--order moment matching property. Meanwhile,
to enhance the algorithm's efficiency, sparse control and deflation techniques
are introduced to further optimize the algorithm. Numerical experiments
demonstrated that, compared to SIP, the accuracy is improved by more than two
orders of magnitude at high frequency points without adding many extra linear
components. Compared to TurboMOR methods, our method achieves a speed
improvement of more than twice while maintaining the same level of precision.

Abstract: A variety of algorithms have been proposed to address the power system state
estimation problem in the presence of uncertainties in the data. However, less
emphasis has been given to handling perturbations in the model. In the context
of linear state estimation (LSE), which is the focus of this paper,
perturbations in the model come from variations in the line parameters. Since
the actual values of the line parameters can be different from the values
stored in a power utility's database, we investigate three approaches in this
paper to estimate the states in the presence of bounded uncertainties in the
data and the model. The first approach is based on interval arithmetic, the
second is based on convex optimization, and the third is based on generalized
linear fractional programming. The three algorithms are applied to multiple
IEEE test systems and compared in terms of their speed and accuracy. The
results indicate that the first two algorithms are extremely fast and give
expected results, while the third suffers from scalability issues and is
unsuitable for LSE.

Abstract: This paper introduces a control-theoretic framework for dynamic payment
routing, implemented within JUSPAY's Payment Orchestrator to maximize
transaction success rate. The routing system is modeled as a closed-loop
feedback controller continuously sensing gateway performance, computing
corrective actions, and dynamically routes transactions across gateway to
ensure operational resilience. The system leverages concepts from control
theory, reinforcement learning, and multi-armed bandit optimization to achieve
both short-term responsiveness and long-term stability. Rather than relying on
explicit PID regulation, the framework applies generalized feedback-based
adaptation, ensuring that corrective actions remain proportional to observed
performance deviations and the computed gateway score gradually converges
toward the success rate. This hybrid approach unifies control theory and
adaptive decision systems, enabling self-regulating transaction routing that
dampens instability, and improves reliability. Live production results show an
improvement of up to 1.15% in success rate over traditional rule-based routing,
demonstrating the effectiveness of feedback-based control in payment systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ensuring safe real-time control of ship-mounted cranes in unstructured
transportation environments requires handling multiple safety constraints while
maintaining effective payload transfer performance. Unlike traditional crane
systems, ship-mounted cranes are consistently subjected to significant external
disturbances affecting underactuated crane dynamics due to the ship's dynamic
motion response to harsh sea conditions, which can lead to robustness issues.
To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and safe model predictive
control (MPC) framework and demonstrate it on a 5-DOF crane system, where a
Stewart platform simulates the external disturbances that ocean surface motions
would have on the supporting ship. The crane payload transfer operation must
avoid obstacles and accurately place the payload within a designated target
area. We use a robust zero-order control barrier function (R-ZOCBF)-based
safety constraint in the nonlinear MPC to ensure safe payload positioning,
while time-varying bounding boxes are utilized for collision avoidance. We
introduce a new optimization-based online robustness parameter adaptation
scheme to reduce the conservativeness of R-ZOCBFs. Experimental trials on a
crane prototype demonstrate the overall performance of our safe control
approach under significant perturbing motions of the crane base. While our
focus is on crane-facilitated transfer, the methods more generally apply to
safe robotically-assisted parts mating and parts insertion.

Abstract: The power flow equations relate bus voltage phasors to power injections via
the network admittance matrix. These equations are central to the key
operational and protection functions of power systems (e.g., optimal power flow
scheduling and control, state estimation, protection, and fault location, among
others). As control, optimization, and estimation of network admittance
parameters are central to multiple avenues of research in electric power
systems, we propose a linearization of power flow solutions obtained by
implicitly differentiating them with respect to the network admittance
parameters. This is achieved by utilizing the implicit function theorem, in
which we show that such a differentiation is guaranteed to exist under mild
conditions and is applicable to generic power systems (radial or meshed). The
proposed theory is applied to derive sensitivities of complex voltages, line
currents, and power flows. The developed theory of linearizing the power flow
equations around changes in the complex network admittance parameters has
numerous applications. We demonstrate several of these applications, such as
predicting the nodal voltages when the network topology changes without solving
the power flow equations. We showcase the application for continuous admittance
control, which is used to increase the hosting capacity of a given distribution
network.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced
natural language understanding and content generation. However, these models
primarily operate in disembodied digital environments and lack interaction with
the physical world. To address this limitation, Embodied Artificial
Intelligence (EAI) has emerged, focusing on agents that can perceive and
interact with their surroundings. Despite progress, current embodied agents
face challenges in unstructured real-world environments due to insufficient
semantic intelligence, which is critical for understanding and reasoning about
complex tasks. This paper introduces the Semantic Intelligence-Driven Embodied
(SIDE) agent framework, which integrates a hierarchical semantic cognition
architecture with a semantic-driven decision-making process. This enables
agents to reason about and interact with the physical world in a contextually
adaptive manner. The framework is inspired by biological cognitive mechanisms
and utilizes bio-inspired principles to design a semantic cognitive
architecture that mimics how humans and animals integrate and process sensory
information. We present this framework as a step toward developing more
intelligent and versatile embodied agents.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for online mitigation of
False Data Injection (FDI) signals to improve the resiliency of Networked
Control Systems (NCSs) and ensure their safe operation in the presence of
malicious activities. The first stage involves meta learning to select a base
time series forecasting model within a stacked ensemble learning architecture.
This is achieved by converting time series data into scalograms using
continuous wavelet transform, which are then split into image frames to
generate a scalo-temporal representation of the data and to distinguish between
different complexity levels of time series data based on an entropy metric
using a convolutional neural network. In the second stage, the selected model
mitigates false data injection signals in real-time. The proposed framework's
effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous simulations involving the
formation control of differential drive mobile robots. By addressing the
security challenges in NCSs, this framework offers a promising approach to
maintaining system integrity and ensuring operational safety.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a cutting-edge communication
technology that has been proposed as aviable option for beyond fifth-generation
wireless communication networks. This paper investigates various group
selection strategies in the context of grouping-based self-sustainable
RIS-aided device-to-device (D2D) communication with spatially correlated
wireless channels. Specifically, we consider both power splitting (PS) and time
switching (TS) configurations, of the self-sustainable RIS to analyze the
system performance and propose appropriate bounds on the choice of system
parameters. The analysis takes into account a simplified linear energy
harvesting (EH) model as well as a practical non-linear EH model. Based on the
application requirements, we propose various group selection strategies at the
RIS. Notably, each strategy schedules the k-th best available group at the RIS
based on the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and also the energy
harvested at a particular group of the RIS. Accordingly, by using tools from
high order statistics, we derive analytical expressions for the outage
probability of each selection strategy. Moreover, by applying the tools from
extreme value theory, we also investigate an asymptotic scenario, where the
number of groups available for selection at an RIS approaches infinity. The
nontrivial insights obtained from this approach is especially beneficial in
applications like large intelligent surface-aided wireless communication.
Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the importance and benefits of the
proposed approaches in terms of metrics such as the data throughput and the
outage (both data and energy) performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new class of parameter estimation laws for
adaptive systems, called \emph{normalized parameter estimation laws}. A key
feature of these estimation laws is that they accelerate the convergence of the
system state, $\mathit{x(t)}$, to the origin. We quantify this improvement by
showing that our estimation laws guarantee finite integrability of the
$\mathit{r}$-th root of the squared norm of the system state, i.e., \(
\mathit{\|x(t)\|}_2^{2/\mathit{r}} \in \mathcal{L}_1, \) where $\mathit{r} \geq
1$ is a pre-specified parameter that, for a broad class of systems, can be
chosen arbitrarily large. In contrast, standard Lyapunov-based estimation laws
only guarantee integrability of $\mathit{\|x(t)\|}_2^2$ (i.e., $\mathit{r} =
1$). We motivate our method by showing that, for large values of $r$, this
guarantee serves as a sparsity-promoting mechanism in the time domain, meaning
that it penalizes prolonged signal duration and slow decay, thereby promoting
faster convergence of $\mathit{x(t)}$. The proposed estimation laws do not rely
on time-varying or high adaptation gains and do not require persistent
excitation. Moreover, they can be applied to systems with matched and unmatched
uncertainties, regardless of their dynamic structure, as long as a control
Lyapunov function (CLF) exists. Finally, they are compatible with any CLF-based
certainty equivalence controllers. We further develop higher-order extensions
of our estimation laws by incorporating momentum into the estimation dynamics.
We illustrate the performance improvements achieved with the proposed scheme
through various numerical experiments.

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of a sectoral Cylindrical Dielectric

low loss, ruggedness, and stability, but their limited bandwidth and size make
them unsuitable for wearable devices. The research addresses these limitations
by proposing a dual mode antenna that operates in EH110 and TE210 modes. The
sectoral CDRA is a quarter segment with Perfect Electric Conductor boundaries,
reducing its size by a factor of four. Mathematical derivations of the field
components for both modes are derived to support the design. To minimize
specific absorption rate (SAR), an Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) surface
is applied to the antennas backside, enhancing compatibility with the
transverse electric modes. The antenna achieves a bandwidth of 0.7 GHz (5.2-5.9
GHz), suitable for biomedical applications, with a measured peak gain of 7.9
dBi and a SAR of 1.24 W/kg when applied to a human arm.

Abstract: We apply a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the two-point
boundary value problem (BVP) arising from the necessary conditions postulated
by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle for optimal control. Such BVPs are known to
be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to
extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes
in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we
develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum
exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we
implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial
and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN
conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the
need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN

Abstract: The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources into the power grid,
with often only black-box models available, challenges long-standing frequency
control methods. Most recent works take a decentralized approach without online
device coordination via communication. This paper considers both dynamic
behavior and communication within secondary frequency control on an
intermediate timescale. We develop a distributed data-driven approach that
utilizes peer-to-peer communication between inverters to avoid the need for a
central control center. To enable a trade off between communication network
requirements and control performance, we present a framework to guide
communication topology design for secondary frequency regulation. Following
design of the inter-agent information exchange scheme, we design a controller
that is structured according to the communication topology with a closed-loop
stability guarantee. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system validate the
framework and illustrate the trade-off between communication requirements and
control performance that is enabled by our approach.

parameters; for example, probabilistic line contingencies. Our proposed
approach imports tools from probability theory, such as concentration
inequalities for random matrices with independent entries. It yields error
bounds for common approximations of the AC power flow equations under parameter

Abstract: The ratio of two probability density functions is a fundamental quantity that
appears in many areas of statistics and machine learning, including causal
inference, reinforcement learning, covariate shift, outlier detection,
independence testing, importance sampling, and diffusion modeling. Naively
estimating the numerator and denominator densities separately using, e.g.,
kernel density estimators, can lead to unstable performance and suffers from
the curse of dimensionality as the number of covariates increases. For this
reason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio
directly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as
the odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an
observation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution.
Additionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a
continuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of
the so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in
the Riesz regression procedure in causal inference. In this paper we show that
all three of these methods can be unified in a common framework, which we call
Bregman-Riesz regression. We further show how data augmentation techniques can
be used to apply density ratio learning methods to causal problems, where the
numerator distribution typically represents an unobserved intervention. We show
through simulations how the choice of Bregman divergence and data augmentation
strategy can affect the performance of the resulting density ratio learner. A
Python package is provided for researchers to apply Bregman-Riesz regression in
practice using gradient boosting, neural networks, and kernel methods.

Abstract: Multi-agent learning faces a fundamental tension: leveraging distributed
collaboration without sacrificing the personalization needed for diverse
agents. This tension intensifies when aiming for full personalization while
adapting to unknown heterogeneity levels -- gaining collaborative speedup when
agents are similar, without performance degradation when they are different.
Embracing the challenge, we propose personalized collaborative learning (PCL),
a novel framework for heterogeneous agents to collaboratively learn
personalized solutions with seamless adaptivity. Through carefully designed
bias correction and importance correction mechanisms, our method AffPCL
robustly handles both environment and objective heterogeneity. We prove that
AffPCL reduces sample complexity over independent learning by a factor of
$\max\{n^{-1}, \delta\}$, where $n$ is the number of agents and
$\delta\in[0,1]$ measures their heterogeneity. This affinity-based acceleration
automatically interpolates between the linear speedup of federated learning in
homogeneous settings and the baseline of independent learning, without
requiring prior knowledge of the system. Our analysis further reveals that an
agent may obtain linear speedup even by collaborating with arbitrarily
dissimilar agents, unveiling new insights into personalization and
collaboration in the high heterogeneity regime.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in heterogeneous treatment effect
(HTE) estimation, the evaluation of HTE estimators remains underdeveloped. In
this article, we propose a robust evaluation framework based on relative error,
which quantifies performance differences between two HTE estimators. We first
derive the key theoretical conditions on the nuisance parameters that are
necessary to achieve a robust estimator of relative error. Building on these
conditions, we introduce novel loss functions and design a neural network
architecture to estimate nuisance parameters and obtain robust estimation of
relative error, thereby achieving reliable evaluation of HTE estimators. We
provide the large sample properties of the proposed relative error estimator.
Furthermore, beyond evaluation, we propose a new learning algorithm for HTE
that leverages both the previously HTE estimators and the nuisance parameters
learned through our neural network architecture. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation framework supports reliable comparisons across
HTE estimators, and the proposed learning algorithm for HTE exhibits desirable
performance.

Abstract: Detecting symmetry from data is a fundamental problem in signal analysis,
providing insight into underlying structure and constraints. When data emerge
as trajectories of dynamical systems, symmetries encode structural properties
of the dynamics that enable model reduction, principled comparison across
conditions, and detection of regime changes. While recent optimal transport
methods provide practical tools for data-driven symmetry detection in this
setting, they rely on deterministic thresholds and lack uncertainty
quantification, limiting robustness to noise and ability to resolve
hierarchical symmetry structures. We present a Bayesian framework that
formulates symmetry detection as probabilistic model selection over a lattice
of candidate subgroups, using a Gibbs posterior constructed from Wasserstein
distances between observed data and group-transformed copies. We establish
three theoretical guarantees: $(i)$ a Bayesian Occam's razor favoring minimal
symmetry consistent with data, $(ii)$ conjugation equivariance ensuring
frame-independence, and $(iii)$ stability bounds under perturbations for
robustness to noise. Posterior inference is performed via Metropolis-Hastings
sampling and numerical experiments on equivariant dynamical systems and
synthetic point clouds demonstrate accurate symmetry recovery under high noise
and small sample sizes. An application to human gait dynamics reveals symmetry
changes induced by mechanical constraints, demonstrating the framework's
utility for statistical inference in biomechanical and dynamical systems.

Abstract: This research proposes a systematic, large language model (LLM) approach for
extracting product and service attributes, features, and associated sentiments
from customer reviews. Grounded in marketing theory, the framework
distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing
interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to
20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a
random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with
human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show
high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity,
confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of
six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds,
delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding.
Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most
strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments,
enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design
targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an
actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across
stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for
improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service
features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.

Abstract: Understanding the continuous evolution of populations from discrete temporal
snapshots is a critical research challenge, particularly in fields like
developmental biology and systems medicine where longitudinal tracking of
individual entities is often impossible. Such trajectory inference is vital for
unraveling the mechanisms of dynamic processes. While Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB)
offer a potent framework, their traditional application to pairwise time points
can be insufficient for systems defined by multiple intermediate snapshots.
This paper introduces Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (MSBM), a
novel algorithm specifically designed for the multi-marginal SB problem. MSBM
extends iterative Markovian fitting (IMF) to effectively handle multiple
marginal constraints. This technique ensures robust enforcement of all
intermediate marginals while preserving the continuity of the learned global
dynamics across the entire trajectory. Empirical validations on synthetic data
and real-world single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the competitive
or superior performance of MSBM in capturing complex trajectories and
respecting intermediate distributions, all with notable computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Biological machine learning is often bottlenecked by a lack of scaled data.
One promising route to relieving data bottlenecks is through high throughput
screens, which can experimentally test the activity of $10^6-10^{12}$ protein
sequences in parallel. In this article, we introduce algorithms to optimize
high throughput screens for data creation and model training. We focus on the
large scale regime, where dataset sizes are limited by the cost of measurement
and sequencing. We show that when active sequences are rare, we maximize
information gain if we only collect positive examples of active sequences, i.e.
$x$ with $y>0$. We can correct for the missing negative examples using a
generative model of the library, producing a consistent and efficient estimate
of the true $p(y | x)$. We demonstrate this approach in simulation and on a
large scale screen of antibodies. Overall, co-design of experiments and
inference lets us accelerate learning dramatically.

Abstract: Modern scientific and engineering design increasingly involves distributed
optimization, where agents such as laboratories, simulations, or industrial
partners pursue related goals under differing conditions. These agents often
face heterogeneities in objectives, evaluation budgets, and accessible design
variables, which complicates coordination and can lead to redundancy, poor
resource use, and ineffective information sharing. Bayesian Optimization (BO)
is a widely used decision-making framework for expensive black box functions,
but its single-agent formulation assumes centralized control and full data
sharing. Recent collaborative BO methods relax these assumptions, yet they
often require uniform resources, fully shared input spaces, and fixed task
alignment, conditions rarely satisfied in practice. To address these
challenges, we introduce Adaptive Resource Aware Collaborative Bayesian
Optimization (ARCO-BO), a framework that explicitly accounts for heterogeneity
in multi-agent optimization. ARCO-BO combines three components: a similarity
and optima-aware consensus mechanism for adaptive information sharing, a
budget-aware asynchronous sampling strategy for resource coordination, and a
partial input space sharing for heterogeneous design spaces. Experiments on
synthetic and high-dimensional engineering problems show that ARCO-BO
consistently outperforms independent BO and existing collaborative BO via
consensus approach, achieving robust and efficient performance in complex
multi-agent settings.

Abstract: Synthetic data has been increasingly used to train frontier generative
models. However, recent study raises key concerns that iteratively retraining a
generative model on its self-generated synthetic data may keep deteriorating
model performance, a phenomenon often coined model collapse. In this paper, we
investigate ways to modify this synthetic retraining process to avoid model
collapse, and even possibly help reverse the trend from collapse to
improvement. Our key finding is that by injecting information through an
external synthetic data verifier, whether a human or a better model, synthetic
retraining will not cause model collapse. To develop principled understandings
of the above insight, we situate our analysis in the foundational linear
regression setting, showing that iterative retraining with verified synthetic
data can yield near-term improvements but ultimately drives the parameter
estimate to the verifier's "knowledge center" in the long run. Our theory hence
predicts that, unless the verifier is perfectly reliable, the early gains will
plateau and may even reverse. Indeed, these theoretical insights are further
confirmed by our experiments on both linear regression as well as Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) trained on MNIST data.

Abstract: A variety of infinitely wide neural architectures (e.g., dense NNs, CNNs, and
transformers) induce Gaussian process (GP) priors over their outputs. These
relationships provide both an accurate characterization of the prior predictive
distribution and enable the use of GP machinery to improve the uncertainty
quantification of deep neural networks. In this work, we extend this connection
to neural operators (NOs), a class of models designed to learn mappings between
function spaces. Specifically, we show conditions for when arbitrary-depth NOs
with Gaussian-distributed convolution kernels converge to function-valued GPs.
Based on this result, we show how to compute the covariance functions of these
NO-GPs for two NO parametrizations, including the popular Fourier neural
operator (FNO). With this, we compute the posteriors of these GPs in regression
scenarios, including PDE solution operators. This work is an important step
towards uncovering the inductive biases of current FNO architectures and opens
a path to incorporate novel inductive biases for use in kernel-based operator
learning methods.

Abstract: We study nonparametric regression and classification for path-valued data. We

transform from rough path theory with local kernel regression. The signature
transform provides a principled way to encode sequential data through iterated
integrals, enabling direct comparison of paths in a natural metric space. Our
approach leverages signature-induced distances within the classical kernel
regression framework, achieving computational efficiency while avoiding the
scalability bottlenecks of large-scale kernel matrix operations. We establish
finite-sample convergence bounds demonstrating favorable statistical properties
of signature-based distances compared to traditional metrics in
infinite-dimensional settings. We propose robust signature variants that
provide stability against outliers, enhancing practical performance.
Applications to both synthetic and real-world data - including stochastic
differential equation learning and time series classification - demonstrate
competitive accuracy while offering significant computational advantages over
existing methods.

Abstract: The remarkable success of machine learning (ML) in predictive tasks has led
scientists to incorporate ML predictions as a core component of the scientific
discovery pipeline. This was exemplified by the landmark achievement of
AlphaFold (Jumper et al. (2021)). In this paper, we study how ML predictions
can be safely used in statistical analysis of data towards scientific
discovery. In particular, we follow the framework introduced by Angelopoulos et
al. (2023). In this framework, we assume access to a small set of $n$
gold-standard labeled samples, a much larger set of $N$ unlabeled samples, and
a ML model that can be used to impute the labels of the unlabeled data points.
We introduce two new learning-augmented estimators: (1) Prediction-Augmented
Residual Tree (PART), and (2) Prediction-Augmented Quadrature (PAQ). Both
estimators have significant advantages over existing estimators like PPI and
PPI++ introduced by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) and Angelopoulos et al. (2024),
respectively. PART is a decision-tree based estimator built using a greedy
criterion. We first characterize PART's asymptotic distribution and demonstrate
how to construct valid confidence intervals. Then we show that PART outperforms
existing methods in real-world datasets from ecology, astronomy, and census
reports, among other domains. This leads to estimators with higher confidence,
which is the result of using both the gold-standard samples and the machine
learning predictions. Finally, we provide a formal proof of the advantage of
PART by exploring PAQ, an estimation that arises when considering the limit of
PART when the depth its tree grows to infinity. Under appropriate assumptions
in the input data we show that the variance of PAQ shrinks at rate of $O(N^{-1}
+ n^{-4})$, improving significantly on the $O(N^{-1}+n^{-1})$ rate of existing
methods.

Abstract: In many business settings, task-specific labeled data are scarce or costly to
obtain, which limits supervised learning on a specific task. To address this
challenge, we study sample sharing in the case of ridge regression: leveraging
an auxiliary data set while explicitly protecting against negative transfer. We
introduce a principled, data-driven rule that decides how many samples from an
auxiliary dataset to add to the target training set. The rule is based on an
estimate of the transfer gain i.e. the marginal reduction in the predictive
error. Building on this estimator, we derive finite-sample guaranties: under
standard conditions, the procedure borrows when it improves parameter
estimation and abstains otherwise. In the Gaussian feature setting, we analyze
which data set properties ensure that borrowing samples reduces the predictive
error. We validate the approach in synthetic and real datasets, observing
consistent gains over strong baselines and single-task training while avoiding
negative transfer.

Abstract: Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is a widely used method for
approximating high-dimensional probability distributions by product measures.
It has been empirically observed that MFVI optimizers often suffer from mode
collapse. Specifically, when the target measure $\pi$ is a mixture $\pi = w P_0
+ (1 - w) P_1$, the MFVI optimizer tends to place most of its mass near a
single component of the mixture. This work provides the first theoretical
explanation of mode collapse in MFVI. We introduce the notion to capture the
separatedness of the two mixture components -- called
$\varepsilon$-separateness -- and derive explicit bounds on the fraction of
mass that any MFVI optimizer assigns to each component when $P_0$ and $P_1$ are
$\varepsilon$-separated for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$. Our results
suggest that the occurrence of mode collapse crucially depends on the relative
position of the components. To address this issue, we propose the rotational
variational inference (RoVI), which augments MFVI with a rotation matrix. The
numerical studies support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the benefits
of RoVI.

Abstract: Regression with non-Euclidean responses -- e.g., probability distributions,
networks, symmetric positive-definite matrices, and compositions -- has become
increasingly important in modern applications. In this paper, we propose deep
Fr\'echet neural networks (DFNNs), an end-to-end deep learning framework for
predicting non-Euclidean responses -- which are considered as random objects in
a metric space -- from Euclidean predictors. Our method leverages the
representation-learning power of deep neural networks (DNNs) to the task of
approximating conditional Fr\'echet means of the response given the predictors,
the metric-space analogue of conditional expectations, by minimizing a
Fr\'echet risk. The framework is highly flexible, accommodating diverse metrics
and high-dimensional predictors. We establish a universal approximation theorem
for DFNNs, advancing the state-of-the-art of neural network approximation
theory to general metric-space-valued responses without making model
assumptions or relying on local smoothing. Empirical studies on synthetic
distributional and network-valued responses, as well as a real-world
application to predicting employment occupational compositions, demonstrate
that DFNNs consistently outperform existing methods.

Abstract: Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithms are deployed in data-sensitive
applications, such as adaptive clinical trials or user studies. Driven by the
privacy concerns of these applications, we study the problem of
fixed-confidence BAI under global Differential Privacy (DP) for Bernoulli
distributions. While numerous asymptotically optimal BAI algorithms exist in
the non-private setting, a significant gap remains between the best lower and
upper bounds in the global DP setting. This work reduces this gap to a small
multiplicative constant, for any privacy budget $\epsilon$. First, we provide a
tighter lower bound on the expected sample complexity of any $\delta$-correct
and $\epsilon$-global DP strategy. Our lower bound replaces the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the transportation cost used by the
non-private characteristic time with a new information-theoretic quantity that
optimally trades off between the KL divergence and the Total Variation distance
scaled by $\epsilon$. Second, we introduce a stopping rule based on these
transportation costs and a private estimator of the means computed using an
arm-dependent geometric batching. En route to proving the correctness of our
stopping rule, we derive concentration results of independent interest for the
Laplace distribution and for the sum of Bernoulli and Laplace distributions.
Third, we propose a Top Two sampling rule based on these transportation costs.
For any budget $\epsilon$, we show an asymptotic upper bound on its expected
sample complexity that matches our lower bound to a multiplicative constant
smaller than $8$. Our algorithm outperforms existing $\delta$-correct and
$\epsilon$-global DP BAI algorithms for different values of $\epsilon$.

Abstract: Recent advances such as self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning
(TTRL) improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) without
additional supervision, yet their underlying mechanisms and statistical
guarantees remain poorly understood. We present a unified framework for
certifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a
statistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the
aggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution
with high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration
bounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority
Certificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when
sufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free
post-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution
by exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of
samples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new
post-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between
sharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central
test-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single
statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning
LLMs.

Abstract: Score-based generative modeling, implemented through probability flow ODEs,
has shown impressive results in numerous practical settings. However, most
convergence guarantees rely on restrictive regularity assumptions on the target
distribution -- such as strong log-concavity or bounded support. This work
establishes non-asymptotic convergence bounds in the 2-Wasserstein distance for
a general class of probability flow ODEs under considerably weaker assumptions:
weak log-concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the score function. Our
framework accommodates non-log-concave distributions, such as Gaussian
mixtures, and explicitly accounts for initialization errors, score
approximation errors, and effects of discretization via an exponential
integrator scheme. Bridging a key theoretical challenge in diffusion-based
generative modeling, our results extend convergence theory to more realistic
data distributions and practical ODE solvers. We provide concrete guarantees
for the efficiency and correctness of the sampling algorithm, complementing the
empirical success of diffusion models with rigorous theory. Moreover, from a
practical perspective, our explicit rates might be helpful in choosing
hyperparameters, such as the step size in the discretization.

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean
Finder is available at: https://leanfinder.github.io

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire
spread predictions. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data
assimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as
remote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This
paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently
proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations
demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational
efficiency, establishing it as a robust and practical method for wildfire data
assimilation. Our code has been made publicly available.

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA
curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for
adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets.
Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates,
quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the
allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this
work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that
integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA
allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight
second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust
region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent
improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,
CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves
higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and
efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and
deployable PEFT.

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and
expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with
linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We
introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task
by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each
nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly
instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity
pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision
variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model
equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a
dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the
established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our
approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents
can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational
modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of

performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant
distribution space.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction
(SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle
early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP
efficiency, existing methods struggle to capture weak early temporal signals.
This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE)
mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded
Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal
representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves
competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time
required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive
validation confirms its efficacy. Code is available at:

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design
decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when
to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve
complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate
predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key
principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the
level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve
complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer
this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a
pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a
subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along
the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness
properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize
the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct
a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a
wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported
by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI
agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely
outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the
data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source
implementation of our system at

Abstract: Sleep disorders have a major impact on patients' health and quality of life,
but their diagnosis remains complex due to the diversity of symptoms. Today,
technological advances, combined with medical data analysis, are opening new
perspectives for a better understanding of these disorders. In particular,
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI model decisions
understandable and interpretable for users. In this study, we propose a
clustering-based method to group patients according to different sleep disorder
profiles. By integrating an explainable approach, we identify the key factors
influencing these pathologies. An experiment on anonymized real data
illustrates the effectiveness and relevance of our approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major
computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we
propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC
OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections
required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a
topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC
feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC
power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-,
118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in
feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC
OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales
efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning
is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and
AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational
overhead in the online deployment.

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test
data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability
distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an
ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome
and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML
systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be
critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal
with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability
distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this
deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance
can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's
performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable
statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More
specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about
50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement
Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test
and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step
forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and
this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a
more informed manner.

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance.
Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which
allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical
grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the
necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's

Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to
boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is
to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely
focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data
valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the
dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep
models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation,
we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output
gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while
preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining,
fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with
substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation
efficient and scalable in practice.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in
real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical
variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state
variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need
for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement
learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network
compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

Abstract: Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response,
yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness
due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood
management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote
sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take
flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these
approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where
to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train
flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but
overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors
may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel
decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ
sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to
optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline
integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable
sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood
reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer
tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable
gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic
decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained
disaster response tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of
designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces
AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil
optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM
selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database,
which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most
increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \%
of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the
performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In
multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence
and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the
previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are
discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.
Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to
conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential
of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple
layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data.
Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on
difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter
symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their
hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and
network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when
learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the
central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries
and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition
between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or
overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this
poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by
recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an
established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically
validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the
internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These
findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and
their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for
individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered
considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous
detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these
detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for
compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using
grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector
quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs
spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where
codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically
selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time,
serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports
long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact
encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool
for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation
of grid-like codes in neural systems.

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI
understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments
remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual
annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We
introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically
explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical
data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -
an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many
of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.
GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into
hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve
comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla
crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of
27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each
annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility
metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning
LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on
downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro
benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source
library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along
with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold
benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

Abstract: Data assimilation, consisting in the combination of a dynamical model with a
set of noisy and incomplete observations in order to infer the state of a
system over time, involves uncertainty in most settings. Building upon an
existing deterministic machine learning approach, we propose a variational
inference-based extension in which the predicted state follows a multivariate
Gaussian distribution. Using the chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics as a testing
ground, we show that our new model enables to obtain nearly perfectly
calibrated predictions, and can be integrated in a wider variational data
assimilation pipeline in order to achieve greater benefit from increasing
lengths of data assimilation windows. Our code is available at

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet powerful technique that injects
randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown
parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear
bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret
typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews
parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends
to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through
empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only
surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with
best-known theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence
systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous

sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large

work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and
bounded variance assumptions (of the concave part) for any batch size. We prove
that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense
neural networks via a novel ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation. Using the
Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output
(before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose
binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is
obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO
matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent
subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some
heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1
and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

Abstract: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution

distribution over network weights that induces predictive mixtures whose
dispersion adapts to the input. FDN is trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo
sampling. We further propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates
interpolation from extrapolation and stresses OOD sanity checks (e.g., that
predictive likelihood degrades under shift while in-distribution accuracy and
calibration are maintained). On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against
strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched
parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and
shift-awareness with standard diagnostics. Together, the framework and protocol
aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular.

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that
aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic
forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared
knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during
inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely
on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization
powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank
adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed
from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and
task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing
approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose
parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of
correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed
to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the
concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is
connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate
representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and
transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in
4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who
frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has
attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login
attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.

Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial
intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural
networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable
efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to
both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to
previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative
regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even
without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be
replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative
exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical
task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence,
establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which
system control is restricted to local parameters.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and
identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate
crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing
adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/atombench_inverse.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on
policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies,
incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording
and metadata including political party and country representation. These
findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy
analysis and decision-making.

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in
discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored
disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge
disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage
hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that
are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge
disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel
criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our
proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed
criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in
genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery
that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially
bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled
information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected
graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental
and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and
recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that
emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for
directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain
perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic
Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From
the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation
strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological
dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views,
S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more
general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7
real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach,
achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and
4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between
memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt
generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing
long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between
memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction
on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a
linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make
correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of
long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the
training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show
that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further
observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its
architecture.

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and
long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits
excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with
other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior
performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on
life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience
their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health
and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog,
complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the
potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a
high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a
government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature
learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were
extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily
interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models
(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular
data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful
counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It
was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the
biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also
conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection
techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary
determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that
health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study
demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly
contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human
behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals
working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical
diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and
variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation
models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early
potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial
inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse
electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open
challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse
EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both
homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG
signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP),
masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust
representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation.
Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive
Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks
are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the
diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages
the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of
embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling
(IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features.
Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning,
demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes
forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and
generalizable neural information processing systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar
rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the
rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and
hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language
feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL
training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information
leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to
behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we
propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a
framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides
exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic
experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure
feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample
self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable
lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing
rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning
Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure
inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a
continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the
quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points
with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic
projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically
projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic
structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence
and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous
mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high
accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated
target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit
well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for
applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms,
where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these
application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation
framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks
under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

Abstract: Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed

results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited

clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for
secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side
invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that
addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training
with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13%
to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an
accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.

Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen
conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for
traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader
spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.
This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%
lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and
resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution
for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for processing EV charging load data in order
to forecast future load predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network,
specifically an LSTM. The framework processes a large set of raw data from
multiple locations and transforms it with normalization and feature extraction
to train the LSTM. The pre-processing stage corrects for missing or incomplete
values by interpolating and normalizing the measurements. This information is
then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory Model designed to capture the short-term
fluctuations while also interpreting the long-term trends in the charging data.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict
charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly),
providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning, energy management, and
grid integration of EV charging facilities. The system's modular design allows
for adaptation to different charging locations with varying usage patterns,
making it applicable across diverse deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented
computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and
deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential
compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and
accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,
INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in
sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization
offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across
layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks
for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform
and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used
in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM
frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision
configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative
analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and
deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier
mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying
strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting.
Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including
hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization
methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this
work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research
prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across
large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings
between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator
architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax
attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$,
while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often
suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned
challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear
Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high
accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO
resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll
N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention
mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$
while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we
demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating
improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses
current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with
slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement
across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and
softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy
foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical
experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary
conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail,
and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a standard tool for uncovering interpretable latent
representations in neural networks. Yet, their interpretation depends on the
inputs, making their isolated study incomplete. Polynomials offer a solution;
they serve as algebraic primitives that can be analysed without reference to
input and can describe structures ranging from linear concepts to complicated
manifolds. This work uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose
representations into quadratic polynomials. We discuss improvements that induce
importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity. This is an initial
step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic
properties.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided
Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including
complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new
standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development.
Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for
integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit
innovation.

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning
paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained
features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the
similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally
prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly
olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with
a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training
time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current
state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively
resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with
low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network
architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing
this challenge through a biologically inspired design. Code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

Abstract: Neural networks that incorporate geometric relationships respecting SE(3)
group transformations (e.g. rotations and translations) are increasingly
important in molecular applications, such as molecular property prediction,
protein structure modeling, and materials design. These models, known as
SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, ensure outputs transform predictably with
input coordinate changes by explicitly encoding spatial atomic positions.
Although libraries such as E3NN [4] and SE(3)-TRANSFORMER [3 ] offer powerful
implementations, they often require substantial deep learning or mathematical
prior knowledge and lack complete training pipelines. We extend DEEPCHEM [ 13]
with support for ready-to-use equivariant models, enabling scientists with
minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate models, such as
SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks. Our implementation includes
equivariant models, complete training pipelines, and a toolkit of equivariant
utilities, supported with comprehensive tests and documentation, to facilitate
both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models.

Abstract: How can short-term energy consumption be accurately forecasted when sensor

our participation in the \textit{2025 Competition on Electric Energy
Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics}, which
challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world
high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL)
pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial
regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard
Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model
achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy.
Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured
nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably,
spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature
trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.
These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact
recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready
energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling

methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we

quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full
Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained
domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models

Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a
series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve
real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the
schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed
worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well
for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained
resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a
fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel
scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a
bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the
service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses
a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand
prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing
algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.
We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving
diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling
efficiency with fairness preserved.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

Abstract: We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an
adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting
arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where
communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While
classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches
address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior
model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions.
This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that
synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method
includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm
that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with
performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training
paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to
capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement
learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal
solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently
outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with
nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly
relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training
presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in
low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware
accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of
approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new
hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition.
Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

Abstract: In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training
in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in
a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to
quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real
world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most
successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion
of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is
well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with
a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation
to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided
by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that
the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a
sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to
solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of
their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a
method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so
that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals
(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method
automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior
work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method
solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain
demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard
benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms
prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity
freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all
anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism
is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents
targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static
graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime
changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across
multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with
network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on
anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks
that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale
temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and
spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through
neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with
structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four
mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.
Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied
post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events
with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley
Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert
weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48
(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism
identification without labeled supervision.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet
their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer
encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution
matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with
subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph
convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update
dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters.
Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose
\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined
architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates
multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and
interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales,
naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting
benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while
providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

Abstract: Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce
SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness
against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work
establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers
practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

Abstract: Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent
years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based
technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning
neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an
attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters
than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages
for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering
unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical
network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies
few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model
generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can
identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different
datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it
significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc
identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to
address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers.
The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy
of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc,
in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy
of 65.7%.

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in
regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents
significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems
and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of
Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively
throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means
obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a
sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by
substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using
Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training
process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by
the original environment.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID
transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,
referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying
on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically
hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one
of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,
hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal
improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the
Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint
fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in
modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively
balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during
training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal
model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal
predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion
tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion
methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during
training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality
encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent
modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal
learning on improving model performance.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and

challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local

resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results
confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable
uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its
robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from
large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of
diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph
foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both
issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be
beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the
suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing
through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the
increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input
features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated
by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that
adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,
we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel
nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with
local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive
experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of
GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the
network depth exceeds $256$ layers.

P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming
that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal
components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that
combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors.
On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of
0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet
(F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results
show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly
enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated
seismic detectors.

Abstract: Current research in Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics mainly emphasizes
resting-state conditions, leaving the performance decline in rest-exercise
scenarios largely unresolved. This paper introduces CrossStateECG, a robust
ECG-based authentication model explicitly tailored for cross-state
(rest-exercise) conditions. The proposed model creatively combines multi-scale
deep convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to ensure
strong identification across different physiological states. Experimental
results on the exercise-ECGID dataset validate the effectiveness of
CrossStateECG, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.50% in the
Rest-to-Exercise scenario (training on resting ECG and testing on post-exercise
ECG) and 94.72% in the Exercise-to-Rest scenario (training on post-exercise ECG
and testing on resting ECG). Furthermore, CrossStateECG demonstrates
exceptional performance across both state combinations, reaching an accuracy of
99.94% in Rest-to-Rest scenarios and 97.85% in Mixed-to-Mixed scenarios.
Additional validations on the ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets further confirmed the
generalization abilities of CrossStateECG, underscoring its potential as a
practical solution for post-exercise ECG-based authentication in dynamic
real-world settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of
EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core
challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional
heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to
reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency
to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware
multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates
prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder
toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware
source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically
estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition,
a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label
interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level,
fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift.
Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\%
for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the
large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive
ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as
acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly
into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables
just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train
generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning
algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be
inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to
three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,
especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the
training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it
is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not
necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent
overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during
training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning
the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to
acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this
approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which
influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can
already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling
workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best
leverage them in support of geological interpretation.

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of
layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer)
is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with
respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool
for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the
spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues,
reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting,
underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We
conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37
datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the
evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between
their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a
foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design
of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry
with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network
architectures and training stability.

introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show
that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning
relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still
significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively

Abstract: Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for
gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime.
In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a
large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective
decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.
In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing
convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an
overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is
that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers
forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD
dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component
corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while
the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows
us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning
rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is
overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global
minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time
with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)
the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with
linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat
global minimum.

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively
remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that
create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are
better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly
understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental
problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph
limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the
infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse
neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as
networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of
different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and
provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon
representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to
study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.
Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse
networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK
correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the
varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework
provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the
trainability of various sparse network architectures.

Abstract: A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and
Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate
CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial
application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced
spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect
of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their
impact on robustness.

Abstract: The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the
underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This
noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior
observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves
generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to
the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in
the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a
simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized
signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training
suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning
process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the
overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite
the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends
to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing
lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing
label noise in gradient-based training.

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid

remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)
with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models'
effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to
support suicide prevention modeling efforts.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.
