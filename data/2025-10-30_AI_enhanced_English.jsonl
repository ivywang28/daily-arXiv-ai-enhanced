Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nat test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in\nCoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking\nprocess, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning\nsteps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise\ncausal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a\nproposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave\nbetween true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final\noutput) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of\nreasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the\ntotal reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's\nprediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning\nsteps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.\nFurthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.\nBy steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform\nor disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we\nhighlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be\ndecorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the\nTrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting\nin a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often\nverbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which\nundermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled\nsubstantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for\nlandmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,\nwe observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,\nwhile improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome\nthis limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at\noptimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper\nlandmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art\nmethods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.\n(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based\nimputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to\nsubstantial accuracy gains.

While their applications in computational fluid\ndynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural\nproblems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the\nGraph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate\nmodeling of dynamic structural problems.\n  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine\nlearning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic\nsimulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in\nnode-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in\nfinite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,\nwhich reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a\nwavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.\n  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz\nHanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the\nphysics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen\nloading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful\npredictions.\n  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial\ninference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity.

In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.
