Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image

architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables
culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving
student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net
(Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework
designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context
by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,
and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing
by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement
analysis. The source code for this project is available on

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy
language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page is

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe

Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D
scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in
autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel
View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not
included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in

Abstract: This paper presents an automated system for cricket video analysis that
leverages deep learning techniques to extract wicket-taking deliveries, detect
cricket balls, and model ball trajectories. The system employs the YOLOv8
architecture for pitch and ball detection, combined with optical character
recognition (OCR) for scorecard extraction to identify wicket-taking moments.
Through comprehensive image preprocessing, including grayscale transformation,
power transformation, and morphological operations, the system achieves robust
text extraction from video frames. The pitch detection model achieved 99.5%
mean Average Precision at 50% IoU (mAP50) with a precision of 0.999, while the
ball detection model using transfer learning attained 99.18% mAP50 with 0.968
precision and 0.978 recall. The system enables trajectory modeling on detected
pitches, providing data-driven insights for identifying batting weaknesses.
Experimental results on multiple cricket match videos demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach for automated cricket analytics, offering
significant potential for coaching and strategic decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D
chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes
volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models

their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that

router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural
Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent
gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of
pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its
effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in
model merging.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units

integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

Abstract: This paper investigates the approximation properties of shallow neural
networks with activation functions that are powers of exponential functions. It
focuses on the dependence of the approximation rate on the dimension and the
smoothness of the function being approximated within the Barron function space.
We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving
that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients
or insufficient smoothness conditions.
  We also establish optimal approximation rates in various norms for functions
in Barron spaces and Sobolev spaces, confirming the curse of dimensionality.
Our results clarify the limits of shallow neural networks' approximation
capabilities and offer insights into the selection of activation functions and
network structures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.
Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a
robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes
applications.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate

safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early

sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the

clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,
including high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks. Code and

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning

reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

Abstract: Transistors are core component across all domains of electrical and
electronic engineering (EEE), such as data centers, electrified transportation,
robotics, renewables and grid applications, etc. Transistors' switching
behavior governs energy loss, carbon emissions, cooling demand, water use,
lifetime, material use and cost etc. throughout EEE. Despite near a century
since the transistor's invention, the understanding of transistor switching
remains fragmented: switching is treated as a black box relying on observed
waveforms, cannot be explained using physical laws alone, and is not integrated
into circuit theory. This forms one of the most critical barriers to
recognizing the true physical boundaries, prohibiting more sustainable
solutions. For example, the conventional Eon prediction model, derived from the
conventional switching analysis, exhibits significant prediction errors
(ranging from 34.41% to 80.05%). Here we present a unified first-principles
paradigm to explain the switching phenomena. Using this paradigm, we revealed
the physical origins and mechanisms of switching-ON phenomena across scenarios,
and derived the proposed Eon prediction model, with error ranging from 0.88% to
11.60%, achieving a 17-fold average improvement. These results demonstrate the
unprecedented power of the proposed paradigm: textbook-level foundations are
established, transforming the fundamental understanding of transistor switching
from empirical to first-principles analysis, and simultaneously stimulating
follow-up research and applications for sustainable development across
disciplines.

Abstract: Accurate and robust surrogate modeling is essential for the real time control
and optimization of large-scale subsurface systems, such as geological CO2
storage and waterflood management. This study investigates the limits of
classical Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) in replicating
pressure and water saturation dynamics under challenging prediction scenarios.
We benchmark CCKM against DMDc and a Hybrid B-only surrogate that reuses DMDcs
bottom B (same step feed through), showing that only CCKM remains stable and
accurate under regime shifts. Two representative cases are considered: (i) an
out of distribution shut in and restart case, and (ii) an in distribution
bottom hole pressure (BHP) drawdown. Results show that only CCKM consistently
maintains stability and accuracy across both scenarios, achieving sub bar mean
absolute error and sub percent Frobenius norm percent change error even under
regime shifts, while DMDc exhibit large unphysical errors during control
transients. The findings demonstrate that strict control coherence is critical
for reliable surrogate modeling, particularly in settings with abrupt changes
in control strategy. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to real time
reservoir optimization and can be integrated seamlessly into existing
optimization and monitoring workflows, enabling fast and trustworthy decision
support in the presence of both expected and unexpected actuation regimes.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODE) are powerful
continuous-time machine learning models for depicting the behavior of complex
dynamical systems, but their verification remains challenging due to limited
reachability analysis tools adapted to them. We propose a novel interval-based
reachability method that leverages continuous-time mixed monotonicity
techniques for dynamical systems to compute an over-approximation for the
neural ODE reachable sets. By exploiting the geometric structure of full
initial sets and their boundaries via the homeomorphism property, our approach
ensures efficient bound propagation. By embedding neural ODE dynamics into a
mixed monotone system, our interval-based reachability approach, implemented in
TIRA with single-step, incremental, and boundary-based approaches, provides
sound and computationally efficient over-approximations compared with CORA's
zonotopes and NNV2.0 star set representations, while trading tightness for
efficiency. This trade-off makes our method particularly suited for
high-dimensional, real-time, and safety-critical applications. Applying mixed
monotonicity to neural ODE reachability analysis paves the way for lightweight
formal analysis by leveraging the symmetric structure of monotone embeddings
and the geometric simplicity of interval boxes, opening new avenues for
scalable verification aligned with the symmetry and geometry of neural
representations. This novel approach is illustrated on two numerical examples
of a spiral system and a fixed-point attractor system modeled as a neural ODE.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents
unique challenges due to unpredictable object motion, frequent occlusions, and
limited appearance cues inherent to aerial viewpoints. These issues are further
exacerbated by abrupt UAV movements, leading to unreliable trajectory
estimation and identity switches. Conventional motion models, such as Kalman
filters or static sequence encoders, often fall short in capturing both linear
and non-linear dynamics under such conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose DMTrack, a deformable motion tracking framework tailored for UAV-based
MOT. Our DMTrack introduces three key components: DeformMamba, a deformable
state-space predictor that dynamically aggregates historical motion states for
adaptive trajectory modeling; MotionGate, a lightweight gating module that
fuses Kalman and Mamba predictions based on motion context and uncertainty; and
an uncertainty-aware association strategy that enhances identity preservation
by aligning motion trends with prediction confidence. Extensive experiments on
the VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTrack achieves
state-of-the-art performance in identity consistency and tracking accuracy,
particularly under high-speed and non-linear motion. Importantly, our method
operates without appearance models and maintains competitive efficiency,
highlighting its practicality for robust UAV-based tracking.

Abstract: This letter introduces a Graph-Condensed Quantum-Inspired Placement (GC-QAP)
framework for reliability-driven trajectory optimization in Uncrewed Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) assisted low-altitude wireless networks. The dense waypoint graph
is condensed using probabilistic quantum-annealing to preserve
interference-aware centroids while reducing the control state space and
maintaining link-quality. The resulting problem is formulated as a
priority-aware Markov decision process and solved using epsilon-greedy
off-policy Q-learning, considering UAV kinematic and flight corridor
constraints. Unlike complex continuous-action reinforcement learning
approaches, GC-QAP achieves stable convergence and low outage with
substantially and lower computational cost compared to baseline schemes.

Abstract: Massive number of simultaneous Internet of Things (IoT) uplinks strain
gateways with interference and energy limits, yet devices often lack neighbors'
Channel State Information (CSI) and cannot sustain centralized Mobile Edge
Computing (MEC) or heavy Machine Learning (ML) coordination. Classical Bayesian
solvers help with uncertainty but become intractable as users and strategies
grow, making lightweight, distributed control essential. In this paper, we
introduce the first-ever, novel epistemic Bayesian game for uplink power
control under incomplete CSI that operates while suppressing interference among
multiple uplink channels from distributed IoT devices firing at the same time.
Nodes run inter-/intra-epistemic belief updates over opponents' strategies,
replacing exhaustive expected-utility tables with conditional belief
hierarchies. Using an exponential-Gamma SINR model and higher-order utility
moments (variance, skewness, kurtosis), the scheme remains computationally lean
with a single-round upper bound of $O\!\left(N^{2} S^{2N}\right)$. Precise
power control and stronger coverage amid realistic interference: with channel
magnitude equal to $1$ and a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
threshold of $-18$ dB, coverage reaches approximately $60\%$ at approximately
$55\%$ of the maximum transmit power; mid-rate devices with a threshold of
$-27$ dB achieve full coverage with less than $0.1\%$ of the maximum transmit
power.Under $80\%$ interference, a fourth-moment policy cuts average power from
approximately $52\%$ to approximately $20\%$ of the maximum transmit power with
comparable outage, outperforming expectation-only baselines. These results
highlight a principled, computationally lean path to optimal power allocation
and higher network coverage under real-world uncertainty within dense,
distributed IoT networks.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
systems provide a new paradigm for reconfigurable and flexible wireless
communications. To enable more energy efficient and spectrum efficient IRS
assisted UAV wireless communications, this paper introduces a novel
IRS-assisted UAV enabled spectrum sharing system with orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM). The goal is to maximize the energy efficiency
(EE) of the secondary network by jointly optimizing the beamforming, subcarrier
allocation, IRS phase shifts, and the UAV trajectory subject to practical
transmit power and passive reflection constraints as well as UAV physical
limitations. A physically grounded propulsion-energy model is adopted, with its
tight upper bound used to form a tractable EE lower bound for the spectrum
sharing system. To handle highly non convex, time coupled optimization problems
with a mixed continuous and discrete policy space, we develop a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on the actor critic framework.
Extended experiments show the significant EE improvement of the proposed
DRL-based approach compared to several benchmark schemes, thus demonstrating
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach with mobility.

Abstract: We prove an exact equality between the minimal quadratic control energy and
the squared normal-quantile gap for terminal halfspaces in linear-Gaussian
systems with additive control and quadratic effort $E(u)=\tfrac12\!\int u^\top
M u\,dt$ where $M=B^\top\Sigma^{-1}B$. For terminal halfspace events, the
minimal energy equals the squared normal-quantile gap divided by twice a
controllability-to-noise ratio $R_T^2(w)=(w^\topW_c^M w)/(w^\top V_T w)$ and is
attained by a matched-filter control. We provide an exact zero-order-hold
discrete-time companion via block exponentials, relate the result to
minimum-energy control, Gaussian isoperimetry, risk-sensitive/KL control, and
Schrodinger bridges, and validate to high precision with Monte Carlo. We state
assumptions, singular-$M$ handling, and edge cases. The statement is a compact
synthesis and design-ready translator, not a universal principle. Novelty:
while the ingredients (Gramians, Cauchy-Schwarz, Gaussian isoperimetry) are
classical, to our knowledge the explicit quantile-energy equality with a
constructive matched-filter achiever for terminal halfspaces, and its
discrete-time companion, are not recorded together in the cited literature.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a transformative approach to addressing urban
congestion, improving accessibility, and advancing environmental
sustainability. Rapid progress has emerged in three tightly linked domains
since 2020: (1) Communication, where dynamic spectrum allocation and
low-altitude channel characterization support reliable air-ground data
exchange; (2) UAM management, with novel air-traffic control concepts for
dense, largely autonomous urban airspace; and (3) Sustainability, driven by
energy-efficient propulsion, integrated charging infrastructure, and holistic

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Distributed resource allocation (DRA) is fundamental to modern networked
systems, spanning applications from economic dispatch in smart grids to CPU
scheduling in data centers. Conventional DRA approaches require reliable
communication, yet real-world networks frequently suffer from link failures,
packet drops, and communication delays due to environmental conditions, network
congestion, and security threats.
  We introduce a novel resilient DRA algorithm that addresses these critical
challenges, and our main contributions are as follows: (1) guaranteed
constraint feasibility at all times, ensuring resource-demand balance even
during algorithm termination or network disruption; (2) robust convergence
despite sector-bound nonlinearities at nodes/links, accommodating practical
constraints like quantization and saturation; and (3) optimal performance under
merely uniformly-connected networks, eliminating the need for continuous
connectivity.
  Unlike existing approaches that require persistent network connectivity and
provide only asymptotic feasibility, our graph-theoretic solution leverages
network percolation theory to maintain performance during intermittent
disconnections. This makes it particularly valuable for mobile multi-agent
systems where nodes frequently move out of communication range. Theoretical
analysis and simulations demonstrate that our algorithm converges to optimal
solutions despite heterogeneous time delays and substantial link failures,
significantly advancing the reliability of distributed resource allocation in
practical network environments.

Abstract: Networked Control Systems (NCSs) are integral in critical infrastructures
such as power grids, transportation networks, and production systems. Ensuring
the resilient operation of these large-scale NCSs against cyber-attacks is
crucial for societal well-being. Over the past two decades, extensive research
has been focused on developing metrics to quantify the vulnerabilities of NCSs
against attacks. Once the vulnerabilities are quantified, mitigation strategies
can be employed to enhance system resilience. This article provides a
comprehensive overview of methods developed for assessing NCS vulnerabilities
and the corresponding mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we emphasize the
importance of probabilistic risk metrics to model vulnerabilities under
adversaries with imperfect process knowledge. The article concludes by
outlining promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Quantized observations are ubiquitous in a wide range of applications across
engineering and the social sciences, and algorithms based on the $\ell_1$-norm
are well recognized for their robustness to outliers compared with their
$\ell_2$-based counterparts. Nevertheless, adaptive identification methods that
integrate quantized observations with $\ell_1$-optimization remain largely
underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we develop a novel $\ell_1$-based
adaptive identification algorithm specifically designed for quantized
observations. Without relying on the traditional persistent excitation
condition, we establish global convergence of the parameter estimates to their
true values and show that the average regret asymptotically vanishes as the
data size increases. Finally, we apply our new identification algorithm to a
judicial sentencing problem using real-world data, which demonstrates its
superior performance and practical significance.

interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a
substantial amount of data is missing, as in recommendation systems heavily
used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the
setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high
dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and
dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test
them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting. We also develop a replica
theory, which becomes exact in the dense limit,to examine the performance of
statistical inference.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of jointly inferring time-varying
network topologies and imputing missing data from partially observed graph
signals. We propose a unified non-convex optimization framework to
simultaneously recover a sequence of graph Laplacian matrices while
reconstructing the unobserved signal entries. Unlike conventional decoupled
methods, our integrated approach facilitates a bidirectional flow of
information between the graph and signal domains, yielding superior robustness,
particularly in high missing-data regimes. To capture realistic network
dynamics, we introduce a fused-lasso type regularizer on the sequence of
Laplacians. This penalty promotes temporal smoothness by penalizing large
successive changes, thereby preventing spurious variations induced by noise
while still permitting gradual topological evolution. For solving the joint
optimization problem, we develop an efficient Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, which leverages the problem's structure to yield
closed-form solutions for both the graph and signal subproblems. This design
ensures scalability to large-scale networks and long time horizons. On the
theoretical front, despite the inherent non-convexity, we establish a
convergence guarantee, proving that the proposed ADMM scheme converges to a
stationary point. Furthermore, we derive non-asymptotic statistical guarantees,
providing high-probability error bounds for the graph estimator as a function
of sample size, signal smoothness, and the intrinsic temporal variability of
the graph. Extensive numerical experiments validate the approach, demonstrating
that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and the joint accuracy of graph learning and signal recovery.

Abstract: Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) has been increasingly employed
in health technology assessments (HTA). By reweighting subjects from a trial
with individual participant data (IPD) to match the covariate summary
statistics of another trial with only aggregate data (AgD), MAIC facilitates
the estimation of a treatment effect defined with respect to the AgD trial
population. This manuscript introduces a new class of methods, termed
arbitrated indirect treatment comparisons, designed to address the ``MAIC
paradox'' -- a phenomenon highlighted by Jiang et al.~(2025). The MAIC paradox
arises when different sponsors, analyzing the same data, reach conflicting
conclusions regarding which treatment is more effective. The underlying issue
is that each sponsor implicitly targets a different population. To resolve this
inconsistency, the proposed methods focus on estimating treatment effects in a
common target population, specifically chosen to be the overlap population.

Abstract: Understanding generalization in overparameterized neural networks hinges on
the interplay between the data geometry, neural architecture, and training
dynamics. In this paper, we theoretically explore how data geometry controls
this implicit bias. This paper presents theoretical results for
overparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability.
First, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls,
we derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension.
Second, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly
probability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of
bounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the
sphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder
to "shatter" with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons,
gradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns
and thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that
is easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent
favors memorization. Our theoretical results consolidate disparate empirical
findings that have appeared in the literature.

Abstract: There has been a surge of recent interest in automatically learning policies
to target treatment decisions based on rich individual covariates. A common
approach is to train a machine learning model to predict counterfactual
outcomes, and then select the policy that optimizes the predicted objective
value. In addition, practitioners also want confidence that the learned policy
has better performance than the incumbent policy according to downstream policy
evaluation. However, due to the winner's curse-an issue where the policy
optimization procedure exploits prediction errors rather than finding actual
improvements-predicted performance improvements are often not substantiated by
downstream policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
strategy called inference-aware policy optimization, which modifies policy
optimization to account for how the policy will be evaluated downstream.
Specifically, it optimizes not only for the estimated objective value, but also
for the chances that the policy will be statistically significantly better than
the observational policy used to collect data. We mathematically characterize
the Pareto frontier of policies according to the tradeoff of these two goals.
Based on our characterization, we design a policy optimization algorithm that
uses machine learning to predict counterfactual outcomes, and then plugs in
these predictions to estimate the Pareto frontier; then, the decision-maker can
select the policy that optimizes their desired tradeoff, after which policy
evaluation can be performed on the test set as usual. Finally, we perform
simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology.

Abstract: Data-driven stochastic optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning and
operational decision-making problems. Sample average approximation (SAA) and
model-based approaches such as estimate-then-optimize (ETO) or integrated
estimation-optimization (IEO) are all popular, with model-based approaches
being able to circumvent some of the issues with SAA in complex
context-dependent problems. Yet the relative performance of these methods is
poorly understood, with most results confined to the dichotomous cases of the
model-based approach being either well-specified or misspecified. We develop
the first results that allow for a more granular analysis of the relative
performance of these methods under a local misspecification setting, which
models the scenario where the model-based approach is nearly well-specified. By
leveraging tools from contiguity theory in statistics, we show that there is a
bias-variance tradeoff between SAA, IEO, and ETO under local misspecification,
and that the relative importance of the bias and the variance depends on the
degree of local misspecification. Moreover, we derive explicit expressions for
the decision bias, which allows us to characterize (un)impactful
misspecification directions, and provide further geometric understanding of the
variance.

Abstract: The use of low-bit quantization has emerged as an indispensable technique for
enabling the efficient training of large-scale models. Despite its widespread
empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its impact on
learning performance remains notably absent, even in the simplest linear
regression setting. We present the first systematic theoretical study of this
fundamental question, analyzing finite-step stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
for high-dimensional linear regression under a comprehensive range of
quantization targets: data, labels, parameters, activations, and gradients. Our
novel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and
data-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization
affects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify
noise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data
and label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error.
Crucially, we prove that for multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent
quantization step), this spectral distortion can be eliminated, and for
additive quantization (with constant quantization step), a beneficial scaling
effect with batch size emerges. Furthermore, for common polynomial-decay data
spectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive
quantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer
quantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how
quantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving
the way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware
constraints.

Abstract: We introduce parametrisation of that property of the available

  structure for the function that is learnt as a model of the
  relationship between the pair of variables, observations of which
  comprise the considered training data. We refer to a parametrisation
  of this property of a given training set, as its ``inhomogeneity
  parameter''. It is easy to compute this parameter for small-to-large
  datasets, and we demonstrate such computation on multiple
  publicly-available datasets, while also demonstrating that
  conventional ``non-stationarity'' of data does not imply a non-zero
  inhomogeneity parameter of the dataset. We prove that - within the
  probabilistic Gaussian Process-based learning approach - a training
  set with a non-zero inhomogeneity parameter renders it imperative,
  that the process that is invoked to model the sought function, be
  non-stationary. Following the learning of a real-world multivariate
  function with such a Process, quality and reliability of predictions
  at test inputs, are demonstrated to be affected by the inhomogeneity
  parameter of the training data.

Abstract: Accurate annual average daily traffic (AADT) data are vital for transport
planning and infrastructure management. However, automatic traffic detectors
across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to
underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have
improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only
point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses
that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly
quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model
with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals,
providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima.
Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with
specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage
probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score
of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional
analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of
AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.

Abstract: While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its
pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is
typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine
learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint,
where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a
barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to
contextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This
paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs
from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable
solution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural,
deep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap
between classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a
fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through
fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped
within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural
lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the
static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on
tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a
fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation
Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors
by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the
geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two
distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen
"behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection
heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source
model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.
This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,
effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We
demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA
adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model
families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve
85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,
quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and
establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet
real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most
retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity
and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval
diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent
understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval
framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and
linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders;
the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and
includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and
backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in
Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST
baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate
latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content
diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for
building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in
mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent
systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM
agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or
rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but
less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems
as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the
quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is
crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant
role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement
learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent
collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback
mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the
debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the
agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical
reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.
Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent
prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation
capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic
workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We
introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt
compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first
prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and
dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation
to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to
numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations.
Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage
and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA,
while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time
compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the
groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off
between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce
high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can
generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same
quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the
model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,
independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using
diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides
a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a
suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x
speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win
rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism
of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to
provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost
and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly
for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge
this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation
and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data
Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data
augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike
state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and
generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from
the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation
strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based
data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought
reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual
reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by
models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset
that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM
reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level
annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or
speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for
detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset
fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning
holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring
could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within
reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting
representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model
activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for
improving safety oversight on reasoning.

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating
marketing strategies before costly real- world deployment. However, post-event
analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the
complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an
LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and
social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation
in a sandbox envi- ronment, our framework enables generative agents to
interact, express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing
decisions without predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the
system delivers actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent
social patterns beyond the reach of con- ventional methods. This approach
offers marketers a scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing,
reducing reliance on time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the
risk of underperforming campaigns.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions,
yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot
tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to
measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal
shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation
through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,
Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for
wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.
AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each
designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this
setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured
by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$
recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and
retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above
$80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high
raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit
measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench
establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent
resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This
paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as
matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To
operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,
the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects
general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,
memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to
evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged"
cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in
knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in
foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The
resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify
both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as
a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong
empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key
limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,
and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot
well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based
metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and
Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible
history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,
which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively
select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess
loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further
introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,
orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic
information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across
different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated
selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,
while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further
surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance
improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them
mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.
Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,
but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work
on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make
'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We
therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is
open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce
valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.
First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean
$\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1).
Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of
constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production
of a valid item rather than error detection and principled,
constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection
deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'
show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks
functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans
respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are
instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external
structure that enforces constraints.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks,
they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks.
However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing
red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or
static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying
behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across
diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous
discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,
a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and
Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the
genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates
the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist
dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles
them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to
enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web
tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently
outperforms existing attack baselines.

Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing
research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection
across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models
for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.
Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have
brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they
directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors
between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to
distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified
feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations
to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we
design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features
into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to
prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling
capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a
global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.
Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection
benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)
and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a
remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four
datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across
different scenarios.

Abstract: Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill
acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through
self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks
exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach
proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent
asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional
frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to
individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge
resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms
within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate
curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous
Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework
that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein
task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through
adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ
static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a
bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task
complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental
validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework
achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that
enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual
Guidance and Self-Reward paradigms and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By
combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the
medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories
collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by
fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective.
Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly
severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing
monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide
timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban
Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that
automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates
structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we
design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for
data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks
demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based
evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual
reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.
This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception
to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models
lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban
management, disaster response and climate resilience.

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but
remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise
mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches
either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited
generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that
enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone,
without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated
reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual
two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts,
extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition,
explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses
retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored
insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently
from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually
without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights,
and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and
intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data
(65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest
baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only
on answers. Code and data are available at:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range
of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making
tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning
actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is
impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental
uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process
inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM
uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these
approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance
in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches
deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables.
However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that
require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM
decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures
uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of
each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles
to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation
during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity
(UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based
decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of
data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over
training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model
(LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief
distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual
priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each
utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding
for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.
Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent
improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on
SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and
slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.
These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute
to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

Abstract: Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen
into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information
before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can
do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool
scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to
temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance -
remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark
derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:
multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information
seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two
regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive
only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with
no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents
can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional
textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,
StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when
agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice
affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary
VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in
perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that
judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing
StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and
multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly
pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid,
developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent
alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor
performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at
around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world
use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the
benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl,
including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent
capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl
into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved
through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark,
state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15%
improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to
practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model,
Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an
H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters,
this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both
AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community,
encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model
capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual
assistants.

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain

To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven,
multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized
metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate
Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic
control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a
real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible
systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms.
Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and
design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and
demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond
average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such
as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple
value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods
encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:
1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,
ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)
they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those
underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we
propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE
alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex
interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal
relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it
applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired
value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also
provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with
different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines
across diverse types of value objectives.

Abstract: Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable
when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances
in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions,
emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an
operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that
couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance
constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum
of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to
scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of
robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States
and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in
India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades
smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting
hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent
performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and
human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a
measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of
reliable real-time forecasting systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that
treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a
textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph
nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->
execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient
Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec
confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the
trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,
and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.
By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,
SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,
constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and
simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the
code soon.

Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of
alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model
to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,
instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on
memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction
through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for
our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model
can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such
as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,
approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative
estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial
artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily
regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or
RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a
meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a
possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work
opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation
practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,
distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's
original dataset.

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is

combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy
generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor
preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return
characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also
integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the
strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach
produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime
shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve
outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are
hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle,
linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address
these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel
framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a
reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key
stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)
generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.
The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and
geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not
faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for
our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution
with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,
sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and
safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and
demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly

performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a
classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding
explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more

Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration,
benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and

Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of
studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground
the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and
premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion
of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the
presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the
expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with
uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks,
and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the
structured side.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by
decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for
each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting
informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving
broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting
retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query
decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting,
where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a
given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an
alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and
demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative
sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank
information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision,
15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of
long-form generation.

Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it
challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While
recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,
they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most
informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a
dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy
via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated
dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of
binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.
Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.
On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and
approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging
unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines,
showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue
policy.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of
evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping
them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research
proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three
topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic
Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named
COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.
This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native
function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings
highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,
BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and
emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct
provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based
thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a
robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more
equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness
of the scientific ecosystem.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation serves as a critical component of precision
medicine, enabling accurate localization and delineation of pathological
regions, such as lesions. However, existing models empirically apply fixed
thresholds (e.g., 0.5) to differentiate lesions from the background, offering
no statistical guarantees on key metrics such as the false negative rate (FNR).
This lack of principled risk control undermines their reliable deployment in
high-stakes clinical applications, especially in challenging scenarios like 3D
lesion segmentation (3D-LS). To address this issue, we propose a
risk-constrained framework, termed Conformal Lesion Segmentation (CLS), that
calibrates data-driven thresholds via conformalization to ensure the test-time
FNR remains below a target tolerance $\varepsilon$ under desired risk levels.
CLS begins by holding out a calibration set to analyze the threshold setting
for each sample under the FNR tolerance, drawing on the idea of conformal
prediction. We define an FNR-specific loss function and identify the critical
threshold at which each calibration data point just satisfies the target
tolerance. Given a user-specified risk level $\alpha$, we then determine the
approximate $1-\alpha$ quantile of all the critical thresholds in the
calibration set as the test-time confidence threshold. By conformalizing such
critical thresholds, CLS generalizes the statistical regularities observed in
the calibration set to new test data, providing rigorous FNR constraint while
yielding more precise and reliable segmentations. We validate the statistical
soundness and predictive performance of CLS on six 3D-LS datasets across five
backbone models, and conclude with actionable insights for deploying risk-aware
segmentation in clinical practice.
